Six days after President Uhuru Kenyatta announced tough measures in a bid to help control the spread of the Covid-19, stakeholders in the entertainment, tourism, education and hospitality sectors took to the streets calling for their lifting.

Following his announcement, five counties including Nairobi were put under partial lockdown that saw the closure of bars, churches and eateries, and cancellation of events and public gatherings.

On Tuesday, the Internet was abuzz with the news that a woman had tried to take her own life by jumping into oncoming traffic.

“Fortunately, the driver stopped the car kabla amkanyage. Wasee wameenda kumuamsha atoke mbele ya gari akaanza tu kulia man, saying hajui vile ataface watoi when she goes home emptyhanded again (On being pulled up, she started crying, saying she's at a loss as to how she would face her children emptyhanded),” read a post on social media.

“In my opinion, the president is a selfish and an unrealistic person who is completely out of touch with reality. How do you close down entertainment joints and some parts of the country without giving relief measures?” said DJ Creme de la Creme.

The DJ relocated to Kericho after finding himself locked down in the countryside for months following the cessation of movement into and out of Nairobi County last year.

Echoing similar sentiments is Bishop Peter Ambuka, who leads the Pentecostal Evangelical Fellowship Africa Church in Kahawa West. In a widely circulated video, the bishop challenged the president on the stringent measures imposed to contain the Covid-19 surge.

“The people of this country have suffered a lot since the pandemic came to this nation. Many have lost their jobs, businesses, livelihoods, matrimonial homes and some of them are living in hopelessness,” said the cleric.

Joining the narrative is gospel artiste Guardian Angel, who was gearing up for an album launch: “It is true that the virus is fatal, but let us not forget that depression and hunger are killers as well and those are some of the issues that will arise as a result of these measures.”

“We cannot ignore the fact that lives are being lost due to the pandemic on a daily basis. But at the same time, if you are to impose a lockdown, at least provide solutions. This was not well-thought-out as there is still confusion surrounding the whole issue,” Pambazuka Entertainment Managing Director Leakey Odera said.",Arts/Culture/Celebrities,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

Israella died in Kenya while receiving treatment for a lung infection. On March 18, Bushiri said his daughter had been hospitalised in the ICU for weeks battling the infection and required a bone marrow donation.

However, the self-proclaimed prophet said Israella, alongside his mother-in-law, was denied entry from Malawi to Kenya the first time she required medical assistance, something which could have prevented his daughter's death, according to the doctor.

""When I spoke to the doctor, he highlighted that if she had not been blocked at the airport the first time she needed to travel to Kenya for medical assistance, she would not have died.

April Fools' Day means we can only expect one thing: some majorly cringe-worthy moments on the social media timeline. Of course, this doesn't just extend to our loved ones and personal social circles but also to the world of celeberities.

Whether they are pop stars, Hollywood legends, or television favourites, celebs love to get in on the April Fools' pranks. However, not all of them go down a treat - especially when they involve jokes around emotive issues such as the Covid-19 pandemic or around pregnancies.

So, here's a few April Fools' that backfired or found some negative reception on social media at the time...

Justin Bieber

Now we begin the trends of celebrities announcing pregnancies than turn out to be non-existent.

Pop legend Justin Bieber was at the centre of controversy in 2019 when he shared an uncaptioned image of a baby scan, causing many to think he was expecting a child with his wife Hailey.

Despite some well-wishes being sent in, others were doubtful due to the date.

However, as with all pregnancy pranks, the risk of upsetting those who have struggled with having or are unable to have children is high.

Justin and his wife Hailey.

Justin ultimately apologised, penning on Instagram: ""There’s always gonna be people offended, there’s also people who don’t take jokes very well, I am a prankster and it was APRIL FOOLS. I didn’t at all mean to be insensitive to people who can’t have children.

""A lot of people I know, their first go to prank on April fools is telling their parents they are pregnant to get a big reaction. But I will apologize anyway and take responsibility and say sorry to people who were offended. I truly don’t want anyone to be hurt by a prank.. it’s like when I shoved cake in my little sisters face for her birthday expecting her to laugh but she cried.

""You sometimes just don’t know what will hurt someone’s feelings not to compare pregnancy with cake in the face but it’s just to paint the picture of not knowing what will offend. Some might have laughed but some were offended .. I think With pranks u sometimes have to roll that dice. #prankster #dennisthemenace#sorry #truly"".

Gwen Stefani

Of course, Justin is not the first celebrity to use the fake pregnancy prank, with No Doubt songstress Gwen Stefani being another to jump on that bandwagon in the past.

Back in 2016, mother-of-three Gwen shared an image of a sonogram with the caption:""It’s a girl [heart emojis]"".

Naturally, some believed she was expecting with partner Blake Shelton, but ultimately it proved to be an April Fool's prank. Gwen Stefani.

That did not stop the backlash to Gwen's post, however, with one follower penning: ""You think this is so funny. Have a care to women out there that are struggling with infertility. This is NOT an April Fool’s joke. This is some woman’s dream. I expected better from you.""

The post remains on Gwen's Instagram page.

Piers Morgan

Back in 2019 when Piers Morgan was still the co-lead presenter of ITV's Good Morning Britain, he announced on April Fool's Day that he would launching a show to challenge his rival Sir Alan Sugar's classic BBC show The Apprentice.

With a fake title card showing up, Piers said he would be launching ""The Assistant"".

He commented: ""We’re very pleased to announced today that… we've been watching The Apprentice slightly lose its lustre I think over the years. Piers said his show would beat The Apprentice.

""Lord Sugar's looking a little bit old, so we’ve decided to take him on full square, a new commission from ITV. I went to the boss of ITV and said ‘look, I think we should do a new version of The Apprentice, but actually go for the people who really hold the power in this country’.""

He added: ""The Assistant. So here we are, a little teaser for my new series. We’ll have more details as the week goes on. It’s gonna be a big show, I think it will replace The Apprentice.""

However, the tongue-in-cheek skit was swiftly rejected as ""fake"" and ""lame"" by viewers on social media.

It was not the first and wouldn't be the last time that Piers found a negative reception!

Lindsay Lohan

Another fake pregnancy that courted backlash was former child star and fashionista Lindsay Lohan.

Back in 2013 in a now-deleted tweet, LiLo took to Twitter to announce: ""It’s official. Pregnant.""

It was rather late in Lilo's time zone at the time so for many around the world it was already April 2, but many still suspected it to be a gag.

Lindsay addressed the controversy herself by deleting the tweet and then tweeting: ""April Fools. Where's everyone's sense of humor?""

That tweet has since been deleted. Lindsay Lohan.

Kim Jae-joong

Last year, singer Kim Jae-joong, best known as Jaejoong of the Korean pop group JYJ sparked controversy when he joked about being diagnosed with Covid-19.

Most of us have a long history on social media and countless posts we don't even remember writing which go back years.

Although the content you share on your personal accounts might only be intended for family and friends, many companies now look up potential employees as part of their checks during the hiring process.

Eliza Kirkby, regional director at recruitment firm Hays, has warned that your digital footprint could be unknowingly stopping you from landing your dream job.

Speaking to Seek, the expert shared her top three social media pitfalls to avoid - and many people are making at least one of the simple errors.

Inappropriate posts

Offensive posts made from your accounts may seem like an obvious one to avoid, but sometimes it's the smaller things that you might not consider that trip you up.

Eliza said some companies will look at your interactions and how you communicate with other people and businesses on social media.

She gave an example, explaining she had seen a company opt against a candidate who had used inappropriate language while making a complaint online.

The timing of your posts

Perhaps most surprisingly, the recruiter said that it's not only what we post, but when we post.

She said she knew of instances where a hiring manager had rejected an applicant for the job because he believed their profiles showed they had spent excessive amounts of time on social media during their working hours.

Contradicting your CV

Eliza said that if the work history you present on your application doesn't match up with your online profile, employers would see this a huge red flag.

If you try to cover up gaps on your CV but your social media shows you spent your time very differently, it's likely to throw up some awkward questions or ruin your chances altogether.

“The worst case, and we have seen it happen, is that you’re removed from the shortlist,"" Eliza warned.

Eliza advised job-seekers to go through all of their profiles and delete anything they are having second thoughts over, as well as considering changing their privacy settings.

She said you should also disable the feature allowing others to tag you in posts that are automatically added to your profile to ensure nothing slips through the net out of your control.",Arts/Culture/Celebrities,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

The Ministry of Health on Wednesday said that Nairobi is the biggest contributor to the increased Covid-19 positivity rate. Over the last nine days, Nairobi has had an increase of a staggering 5,718 cases as the third wave of the pandemic continues to cause alarm in Kenya.

The government rolled out vaccination on March 5, 2021; targeting health workers, security personnel, clergy, teachers and other staff in learning institutions. And now, persons aged 58 years and above have been added to the list of those to receive the vaccines, with data showing that they account for 60 per cent of the deaths recorded so far.

On Thursday, the Nairobi Metropolitan Services (NMS) announced that it had received batches of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and had distributed the same to several facilities. NMS asked those eligible to visit the listed facilities with their job cards for identification.

Below is the list of places where you can be vaccinated for Covid-19 in Nairobi.

The purpose of dating is to find the right person with whom we want to spend the rest of our lives. Dating gives you a chance to know your partner well and see if you are compatible. It allows you to know if you can accept the other person the way they are or find someone else.

And when two people get married, they become one and vow to stay together; for better or worse, sickness and health till death do them part. Therefore, one has to be completely that this is the person they want to marry.

So how long a couple should date before getting married?

The truth is, there's no specific definition of what's ""normal"" when it comes to the question of 'how long should you date before getting married?' From friends to family members and even colleagues, almost everyone will have an opinion on the subject.

Julie Spira, an online dating expert and digital matchmaker says: ""There are some couples who know on the first date that they've found the one and get engaged quickly, while others take the time to get to know someone well before putting a ring on it.""

Most relationship experts will recommend about 25 months of dating. They say that during this period of time, the couple gets ample time to know each other, know if the other person is totally committed to the relationship, how comfortable they are around each other, if they trust each other, and most importantly if they are in love.

Research by Emory University found out that couples who'd been together for at least three years before getting engaged were less likely (39 per cent) to get divorced than couples who got engaged within the first year of dating.

""Everyone puts their best foot forward during the courting stage, which is typically the first three months of the relationship.

""When your relationship is brand new, you haven't gone through the bumps on the road together, traveled on vacation together, or gone through a traumatic event such as the death of a family member or loss of a job,"" says Julia Spira.

Relationship expert and the author of My Husband Won't Have Sex With Me, Dawn Michael, agrees that couples should take their time to know each other before marriage as it adds to a lasting relationship.

""Each couple is different depending on age and circumstances, but a reasonable amount of time to be engaged is one to three years,"" says Dawn Michael.

Living together

Simply because a couple isn't married yet, doesn't mean they are not creating a life together. In the modern world, it's common to find couples living together as it's becoming socially acceptable.

So, does living together before marriage help a couple have a long-lasting relationship?

According to findings from a survey by Pew Research Centre in 2019, couples who lived together had a better chance of a successful marriage compared to those who did not cohabit.

Marriage and family therapist, Rebecca Hendrix, opines that moving in together is a personal choice. However, she advises that a couple should spend some time living together to establish how they are around each other and, more so, how they resolve a conflict.

""A successful marriage requires a lot of work, and it's like driving a car—you need two hands on the wheel. If one person stops driving, the car will veer off the road. It's not easy to just walk away once you're married, so it's extremely important to be able to resolve conflict in a way that's sustainable,"" says Hendrix.

Bottom line

I have seen couples who got married after months of dating, and they've remained married for a long time. On the other hand, I have seen couples who got married after five years of dating and still got divorced. Does this mean that the period of dating doesn't really matter as long as the couple loves each other?

If you wonder if it's too soon to start talking about marriage with your significant other, think about all the experiences you've shared, and the memories created.

Have you seen your partner at his lowest and vice versa? Do you know your partner's strengths and flaws? Have you had enough time to learn about his background and family? These are some of the questions you should ask yourself before making the decision to get married.",Arts/Culture/Celebrities,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

Bishop Peter Ambuka, who leads the Pentecostal Evangelical Fellowship Africa Church in Kahawa West was just relaying a message, not knowing that his statement would be widely shared.

The pastor, after prayer and meditation, proceeded to give his sermon, along with a message to President Uhuru Kenyatta on March 28, which has since gone viral.

“God gave me the message and its intention was to bring positive change and productive discussions that will steer our country forward,” he told The Standard yesterday, adding that all he said in the widely shared clip was self-explanatory and that there was no need to add more.

According to the man of the cloth, it was good that his statement sparked a conversation, as that was God’s plan for the message he gave that day.

In the widely circulated video, the bishop challenged the president and the country’s leadership on the cause of the third wave of the Covid-19 surge.

“I am doing this via social media because in this country there is no way you can reach your president - even if you, the voters are his employer. I believe this should not be the case,” said Ambuka.

The pastor added that all leaders need to realise that they are there to serve the citizens and to listen to them, hence their election every five years.

“I bring this up because of the curfew and the lockdown that has been imposed by you, Mr President. Your Excellency, the people of this country have suffered a lot since the pandemic came to this nation. Many have lost their jobs, businesses, livelihoods, matrimonial homes and some of them are living in hopelessness,” said the pastor.

He went on to narrate that just after the new regulations were imposed, a distraught Christian had reached out to him via social media, revealing that she had reached her end.

The woman, who was in mental anguish, said the bishop, told him that her small eatery would have to be shut down with the new measures, and she has lost her livelihood, leading her into a suicidal state.

“When the pandemic started, we joined forces with you and we endured the lockdown for more than four months. We wanted to fight this virus and eliminate it. We endured our job losses, businesses were closed and our livelihoods taken away from us in the hope that everything would return to normal. But as soon as the curve started to flatten, we thought our lives would return to normal, then you, Mr President, and your brother Raila Odinga - started the BBI reggae,” said Ambuka.

The pastor condemned the political activities that took place early this year, referring to the Building Bridges Initiative rallies as the country's leadership criss-crossed the nation, disregarding the laid down Covid-19 protocols.

“It is this careless action by you politicians that has made political rallies to be the super-spreaders of this virus. And this can be confirmed by the number of politicians that have contracted the virus, some who have succumbed to it. Mr President, you and your fellow politicians are to blame for this devastating third wave. Unfortunately, it is we the common citizens who have to carry the burden and suffer the consequences,” said the clergyman.

The bishop further criticised the lavish lifestyles lived by wealthy politicians, which he said, were funded by taxpayers whose livelihoods have been snatched away from them.

He urged the government to embark on massive testing and vaccination in the locked-down counties and work to completely eradicate the virus, rather than delay its spread and impose stricter measures once the rising cases get out of hand.

The bishop then called out the president’s treatment of the church and places of worship, saying that in announcing the closure of these places, he insulted the leaders of churches and disregarded that the places of worship had religiously followed the protocol and were not to blame for the surge in coronavirus infections.

The pastor is not alone in condemning the new stricter Covid-19 regulations. Another video that has made rounds on social media has been one by popular human rights activist Boniface Mwangi.

In his video released on Instagram and Facebook, Mwangi said that since the pandemic struck, life has been nearly unbearable for Kenyans, who are enduring hiked matatu fares, increased fuel costs and closure of businesses.

“There was a little reprieve when people thought that they could handle reopening their business with the relaxed coronavirus measures. But as soon as the economy was reopened, political rallies and BBI talk took priority, leading to a surge in infections,"" said Mwangi.

""As a citizen, you wore masks, paid hiked fares to allow social distancing in matatus, followed the regulations and did your part. Now that the pandemic has come back bigger and stronger, the government is not prepared, despite spending Sh250 billion.”

Mwangi criticised the lack of Intensive Care Unit beds and space in hospitals, adding that the government had nothing to show for money spent and its preparedness for the infection surge.

“What does the president do? Instead of punishing the people who were supposed to ensure that they were ready for the third wave, he punished you and I and decided that we all lose our jobs by locking down the country again,” he said.

He called the lockdown measure a move made to appease the rich, who were concerned that their employees would catch the virus from the slums and ghettos and infect them.

“We are suffering because our leaders are completely silent on the topic of the pandemic and consequent lockdown. As Kenyans, as we go through this, let us never forget what this government has made us feel and go through,” said Mwangi.

The president issued new Covid-19 lockdown measures on March 26 following rising cases of infection. He announced restrictions into and out of Nairobi, Machakos, Kiambu, Kajiado and Nakuru. Further, curfew hours were adjusted from 4am to 10pm to 4am to 8pm in the affected counties.

Public gatherings were banned and bars ordered to close. Restaurants were also directed to only provide take-away services.

The president said that the measures are temporary and necessary to contain spread of the disease and stop further loss of lives, adding that a lack of action would mean worse consequences.",Arts/Culture/Celebrities,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

She ascribes to Neopaganism, draws healing and inspiration from nature and her tattoos fill her with contentment from the shell she felt was her un-inked body.

Wakenya Clewis, a US-based Kenyan singer and social influencer has both friends and strangers intrigued by her controversial lifestyle.

She became a critic of the Black Lives Matters movement and supported former US president Donald Trump, last year.

She says she believes most Black-Americans are more racist than white white people: “Black is not African and African is not Black”. Branded a rebel by her own, the non-conformist says her life has been under constant threat and she has become a licensed gun owner to defend herself should the hate turn physical.

Wakenya, the Kenyan Hippie, as she is commonly known to her more than 200,000 TikTok followers, first came into public limelight in March last year when she tried to become the cover girl for Inked Magazine – US. Kenyan Hippie.

Having moved to the US in 2013 and acquired her duo citizenship in 2019, Wakenya started changing her perspective towards social issues; among them religion and culture as well as racial and political groupings.

George Floyd's killing in May 2020 triggering a fierce protest among people of colour across the US, was Wakenya’s turning point.

“George Floyd’s death was an eye opener. I realised that Black Lives Matter (BLM) is a very sketchy organisation and movement. When the protests came up around June, most of my African friends were not happy the way Africans were negatively viewed here. Black Americans said we were stolen and disturbed; I went on TikTok to ask what they knew about African history. I ended telling them that if we were stolen they had been bought. That tells you I was a very big supporter of BLM until I discovered that there was a lot of hypocrisy around the movement,” the singer who also doubles as a model and business consultant says of the events that saw her change her stance.

“Around this time the racism debate in America became heated and that is when I discovered there are two different kinds of black (people); one does not believe in victim mentality. That black has a conservative approach to life. The other has a victim mentality. They are the old guys who keep on revisiting the racism debate. Kenyan Hippie.

“As I challenged their perspective on BLM, they called me an outcast and threatened to revoke my black card. They called me out for being in an interracial relationship. That is when I discovered that there is oppression and racism among blacks,” Wakenya says.

The State of Florida resident adds that she voted for Trump because of his pro-American policies.

She says people should stop viewing and judging Africans by skin colour. This new advocacy, she says, has made her many enemies.

A lot, she says, has changed in her life since the Covid-19 pandemic struck early last year. As a self-employed lady dealing with entertainment and events, a sector that saw festivals get cancelled with business losses ruling the day, Wakenya says she had to undergo identity and spiritual regrowth.

She also went through divorce. And with social lifestyle grinding to zero, she resorted to social media where she says she started educating people on the truth about Africa. This is where she found new friends and community.

Wakenya who lost her tattoo body count at 60 says her inked skin is not just an artistic expression of what she feels about life but her connection with nature. This, she says, forms part of her spirituality.

She says she ascribes to neopaganism - a concept used to designate a variety of religious and spiritual movements based on different lines of paganism.

Each of her tattoos costs between Sh20,000 and Sh60,000 a huge cost that she terms an investment that will last as long as she lives, and she is not about to stop.

“Right now I am finishing inking my arms and back. Then move back to the legs. Some people judge me while others compliment (me) on TikTok where I show most of my body art. At the end of the day, I feel badass. This is my life,” she says.

“I have a music producer here (US) and back in Kenya but with everything going down with Covid, we couldn’t do much recording. I ended up applying my artistic skills on TikTok where I also did a session based on the amazing Kenyan poet Caroline Nderitu. In a short span, I got a wild following and now, this is one flat-form I am using to advocate for social change in uniting people with different racial mindsets,” Wakenya ends.",Arts/Culture/Celebrities,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

Getting insurance is sensible. In most cases, we insure our cars, houses and even our lives as it is become a modern part of life. However, when it comes to the rich and famous, a lot more is at stake. From legs to vocals to breasts and hair, these celebrities spend millions to have their “assets” covered to protect their careers in the limelight.

Mariah Carey

The We Belong Together singer kicks off the list with most expensive insured body part compared to any other celebrities. After becoming the face of Gillette's Legs Of A Goddess campaign in 2006, Mariah reportedly insured her legs for Sh109.8 bilion ($1billion).

Miley Cyrus

Being a singer, it would make sense that the Wrecking Ball hit-maker would insure her tongue. However, Miley’s decision to give her tongue a Sh109.8 billion ($1billion) price tag has nothing to do with its function.

During an interview with Barbra Walters, Miley stated: ""I was so embarrassed to be on the red carpet, and so many of disgusting photographers would tell me to blow a kiss, and that is not me!

Since then, sticking her tongue out become her trademark, thus, insuring the organ. Miley Cyrus.

Daniel Craig

While other celebrities insure individual body parts, Daniel Craig decided to go for the whole package. The actor, just like Tom Cruise, performs his own stunts for the James Bond movies.

Stories abound of Kenyan women whose hearts melt and knees become weak seconds after a man introduces himself to them as a foreigner, preferably a white man, a west African (especially a Nigerian or Ghanian) or a Congolese. Most Kenyan women accuse their male counterparts for not being romantic, caring and loving. And they take it as holy writ that foreign men are a better deal.

Unfortunately, some rogue foreigners have discovered this weakness in Kenyan women, and are now milking it for all its worth; using and dumping them with appalling impunity. Some of these women allegedly ‘give it up’ on the very first night of their meeting with the said foreigners and before they know it, they have been dumped!

Take the case of Rose Atieno. She could not resist when Yemi Adesanmi, a man who introduced himself as a Yoruba from Nigeria hit on her. He was irresistible, she says, and his accent alone not only tickled but excited her.

“No man speaks in as a way as sweet as Yemi. He had a sexy accent,” she says. “Besides the accent, there is just something very charming about him. I fell for him instantly. The next day we were at his house, enjoying ourselves. In less than a week, Yemi had vanished. I don’t know what happened.”

Oil tycoon

Yemi’s apartment turned out to be a house rented by a different chap who deals with imports from Nigeria. How could he fizzle out on her like that, leaving her high on teenage stirrings of romance? It is a question that Atieno is yet to find an answer to. There are more Kenyan neighbourhoods, especially in Nairobi, that teem with brothers from far west. You need not investigate them to know where they come from; they are loud and their accent tells their nationality.

Many Kenyan women currently date Nigerian, Ghanian or Congolese men. What is so special about foreign men? Many men wonder.

Atieno is not alone. In the leafy suburb of Kileleshwa, not long ago, Eunice Njeri became easy prey for a man of Norwegian origin. “He told me I was beautiful and bright. Every day we bumped into each other, he took my hand and kissed it.

Every other week I would receive a bouquet of colourful flowers – with a card that told of his love for me and how special I was in his heart,” a giggly Rose says, as she talks to this writer over coffee.

The said man (name withheld), now relatively well known in the business circles, has a sweet tongue, and plays his cards close to his chest. Sly and witty, he took his time and showed no interest to rush Njeri to bed.

For over three months, the man straddled the fringes of her life; posing with the character of a caring man interested in a long-term relationship. When he was done ‘babysitting’ her with love, he invited her to his palatial house. She didn’t resist, even slightly, his lecherous moves. At last, the long-term relationship was consummated.

Living in bliss

Then came the time to unleash the truth. “You know Eunice,” she recalls the man saying, “I often host friends from abroad and they love meeting Kenyan girls over here. Could you be coming to our parties along with a few friends?” A befuddled Eunice went back home.

Overnight, she kept thinking how he had treated her well. He had no ill motives, she convinced herself. And so she agreed to bring her friends along to her boyfriend’s ‘harmless’ parties. She was living in bliss and she didn’t want to think of it as a lie.

She was shocked to find out months later that her knight in shining armour was actually running a brothel-like entity for pay. He had been strapped of cash, and was getting evicted off the premise. She confronted him. But there was nothing much to extract from her lover as he rolled his suitcase into a cab en route to the airport.

“I was shocked. I couldn’t believe that he was actually flying back to his country without informing me or caring to explain what had just happened,” says a distraught Njeri.

He left her in the cesspool of rejects as he flew off to bliss by himself.

Meet Mwanaidi Kadze from Mombasa. Her story, though not quite similar to Njeri’s, has all the makings of wealth-related unions. She met an Italian tourist while working at a beach resort in Malindi. Mascimilano (as she pronounces his name) charmed her and proposed that they live as husband and wife.

He floated the idea with her that they rent a block of land not far from the ocean line to put up a restaurant for business. She left her meagre salary behind and swooped in on the sweet life that stood before her. “The lease was in my name since he was a foreigner. Putting up the restaurant was not a problem really.

When the business was up and running, Kadze became the manager of the enterprise. In the meantime, her prince charming enjoyed full benefits that come with ‘marriage’, though they didn’t consummate the union legally.

A few months later, and with the business doing well, Mascimilano flew back to Italy with a promise “to come back and settle with her, have children and live happily ever after.” That was the last time she heard his voice. He took off with all the money, which he apparently needed for a return ticket and to ferry his few belongings from Italy.

She gave up waiting for him and the lease ended just a month later, forcing her to resume the hard life of fending for herself.

Sex tourism is rife

In the Coast region, it is not only young women like Kadze who find themselves at the wrong end of foreign love gone awry. Men too get used.

Take the case of Ali Yusuf – a young virile man in his mid-twenties. He met a German woman he describes as ‘bonge la mke’. She, by European standards that glorify svelte women, wouldn’t pass for an attractive woman.

But she was here to enjoy herself; and who else to help her achieve her purpose than a beach boy who is desolate and looking for cheap money.

Yusuf says: “We both knew what we wanted. She wanted a good time with a local and I was after someone who had money to offer. It was mutual from the start. Besides, she was too old for me to hope that it would last long. I knew she wanted to use me and fly back to her country. So I also syphoned as much as I could. She bought me a fishing boat when she left and as far as the deal goes, I was happy even after she left.”

Juma Munrad, Yufuf’s friend with whom they plied the beach to meet customers, isn’t as happy as Yusuf is, though. He too, met a foreigner who gave him hopes of heaven and grandeur. He was, however, shocked when his foreign girlfriend dumped him for a hunkier, dreadlocked masseur.

“It all happened as I watched,” he says, visibly disappointed. “ I am the one who took her around and showed her places when she landed here. We lived a cosy life inside a beautiful hotel room. I am also the one who took her to the massage parlour where her new man worked. I feel hurt and broken-hearted because I had hopes that we would last,” he adds.

Back in Nairobi, there is a Chinese revolution swirling along the sides of Thika Road Superhighway. Just as fast as the cars that glide on its tarmac, the road construction workers from the Oriental powerhouse were quick at luring Kenyan women into their beds. The story of the girl who gave birth to a baby with Chinese features, and couldn’t identify the man responsible rings true.

Fell pregnant

The notion that Chinese is synonymous with ‘fake’ apparently has no ground on your way to Thika. The Chinese came, built the road, and left behind a generation that may never know who really fathered them. Gladys Wanjiku, from Githurai, had to stop her studies at a university located off Thika Road after she fell pregnant, thanks to a Chinese foreman who supervised work to remodel the former Githurai roundabout into an overpass.

She hoped he would propose and marry her but the man gave her money to stop pestering him because he had a family back in Guangzhou and he is only allowed to have a maximum of one child back in his country. Gladys is just part of lingering statistics that show Kenyans easily falling prey to foreigners and their whims – for nothing more than the promise of bliss or a good life.

However, it is not all gloom and doom, as some have had great relationships with foreigners, which end up in happy marriages.",Arts/Culture/Celebrities,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

Demi Lovato has hinted that she's having a tough time in the wake of her split from fiancé Max Ehrich. The singer and former Disney star told fans ""This has already been the longest October of my life"" just a couple of days into the month. She also posted a picture of a neon sign that read ""Good vibes only"". The 28-year-old hasn't had an easy time lately. Demi, who has been open about her past struggles with addiction and mental health, dramatically split from actor Max not long after they'd got engaged.

It comes after Max sensationally claimed that she had used him in a ""calculated PR stunt"". He said in an Instagram video: ""It’s just the craziest thing. This is the most bizarre experience that I hope no one ever has to experience, ever. Because no person deserves to feel this way. It's a calculated PR stunt, but my team is going to hate me for saying any of this.""

They have respect and love for one another and will always cherish the time they spent together.""

Justin Timberlake and wife Jessica Biel have secretly welcomed their second child together. NSYNC member Lance Bass announced the exciting news during an interview with Entertainment Tonight. Lance went on to say that their NSYNC group chat is filled with updates of each of their families, and claims he's already seen snaps of Justin's newborn. He added: ""The baby is cute, of course. It's Justin and Jessica!"" However, Lance refused to spill on the tot's name, adding: ""That's a good question. Justin would kill me!""

Meanwhile, the showbiz couple have stayed out of the public eye for the past few months amid lockdown, and have yet to share the news on social media. Justin and Jessica - who tied the knot in 2012 - are already proud parents to five-year-old son Silas. Reports of the pair's second child being born began circulating back in July, when Jessica's mum Kimberly Conroe Biel, 65, was said to have devoted much of her time in the company of her daughter and her newborn, according to DailyMail.com. It appeared the Hollywood beauty kept her pregnancy a secret for nine months - much like billionaire reality star Kylie Jenner. The pair were last seen in public on March 25.

Mirror Online has contacted Jessica and Justin's reps for comment. Fans were sure Justin let slip a big clue his wife was reportedly pregnant back in July. Followers were sold on the idea the star had already left a major tip off on his Instagram account days before the news hit headlines. Justin said the summer was going to ""look a little different this year"" alongside a picture of the pair. He wrote: ""TBT time machine. Summer’s gonna look a little different this year.""

""A few weeks ago, I displayed a strong lapse in judgement – but let me be clear – nothing happened between me and my co-star.

He went on: ""I drank way too much that night and I regret my behavior. I should have known better. This is not the example I want to set for my son. I want to apologize to my amazing wife and family for putting them through such an embarrassing situation, and I am focused on being the best husband and father I can be. This was not that.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have reportedly agreed to be filmed for a Netflix reality series, with the former Hollywood actress keen for people to see the ""real her"". Their Sh14.1billion deal with the streaming giant had initially been understood to revolve largely around producing and voice over work. But a source told The Sun the show would afford the world ""a glimpse into their lives"" despite the pair's insistence they moved to the US to get away from alleged media intrusion.

The Sussexes said they hoped to ""shine a light on people and causes around the world"" as they stood down from senior royal duties. A source said: ""They may have had all these lofty ideas about producing epics highlighting environmental causes and the poverty gap, but Netflix obviously want their pound of flesh."" They added the concept is ""tasteful"" and not a "" Katie Price and Peter Andre-style reality show"" but would focus on their charity work.

It is understood the cameras would follow them for three months, though it's currently unclear if it will include footage inside their lavish Montecito home where they secretly moved in July. Majesty Magazine editor Ingrid Sew said the whole idea ""appears rather hypocritical"" as Harry and Meghan said they moved to California to get away from the spotlight. PR expert Mark Borkowski said, however, they are ""doing this on their own terms"", adding Netflix's big hits are all reality shows ""so it makes sense"", but would be something the Royal Family ""will find hard to stomach"".

Netflix has confirmed the Sussexes have a number of projects in the pipeline, including a nature docuseries and an animated show about inspiring women. It comes after claims their intervention into the US election last week was a ""violation"" of their deal with the Queen to leave Britain. Harry and Meghan appeared in a video from their Sh1.4billion California mansion to plead with Americans to ""reject hate speech, misinformation, and online negativity"". Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.

Members of the royal family are supposed to be politically neutral - something Harry acknowledged, making it clear he had never voted in a UK election. But under the Sandringham accord - thrashed out in March when they announced they wanted to turn their back on the UK and move abroad - they vowed that ""everything they do will uphold the values of Her Majesty"".

The 63-year-old Anderson Ofafa Estate in Kisumu will undergo a Sh3 billion facelift thanks to the County Pension Fund and Laptrust Fund. The county authorities have embarked on a two-year low-cost housing project to give the estate a new look befitting Kisumu city status. On Wednesday, Governor Anyang' Nyong'o laid the foundation stone for the houses of retirees from the defunct Kisumu Municipality.

Some tenants have lived in the houses for more than 20 years and were paying as low as Sh4,000 for a one-bedroom or two-bedroom house. But now, the houses, which they have lived in for years, are set for an upgrade with a vision to make them homeowners in the noble low-cost affordable housing project mooted by President Uhuru Kenyatta. Kenya’s Affordable Housing Programme (AHP) was launched in December 2017 by President Kenyatta as one of the national government’s four pillars of growth.

The Kisumu Housing Project comes at a time when the city's bulging population is continuing to pile pressure on housing demand amid an acute shortage of low-cost houses. Currently, demand for housing, according to the County Lands and Housing Executive Dickson Obungu is 250,000 annually against a supply of 50,000 as the city grows.

Currently, the proportion of the urban population in Kisumu has risen from 482,327 in 1979 to 664,086 in 1989 to 804,289 in 2009 968,909 persons with 474,687 males and 494,222 females. The county's population stands at 1,155,574 as per last year's census. Acting city manager Abala Wanga envisages Kisumu population will double in next 20 years.

Nyong'o said the growing population has necessitated fresh spatial planning. ""So we have to look at the distribution of people and activities in urban areas and towns to improve their housing, economic and social environments,"" Prof Nyong'o said. Laptrust CEO Hosea Kili released a cheque of Sh76,000 each and an additional Sh100,000 to facilitate the relocation of the affected 1,200 families.

The Andersen Ofafa Estate was home to 246 families staying in 39 blocks. Each family was paid a year's rent based on a mutual agreement with CPF and LapTrust. The former tenants will be given priority on buying the new modern housing units. According to the project's architect Peter Wasilwa, each of the one-bedroom houses will be offered to the former tenants at an affordable cost of Sh1.5 million. The two-bedroom houses will go for Sh2.5 million, while a three-bedroom house cost Sh3.5 million. Non-tenants will part with Sh1 million more for the units.

“From our research, there has been a growing need for content for children on our screens and as a result, the commission introduced the Best Children Production category to acknowledge those who have developed concepts to accommodate our young ones as screen audiences,” Owase said. Maisha Magic’s Pete, Majuto, Kovi and Selina series have been nominated in Best TV Drama category while their lead actors/actresses have also been nominated for their roles. The awards ceremony at Sarit Centre will feature a few guests in line with Ministry of Health guidelines on social distancing.

“For long, artistes have been complaining about being underpaid, poor working conditions and policies. In response, we are coming up with new guidelines to achieve the full potential, development and growth of the local talent,” Owase said. He added that, through its parent Ministry of ICT, Innovation and Youth Affairs, KFC is championing a National Screen policy that will streamline funding, incentives, investment and capacity development.

He noted that a film-friendly production environment will involve a shared, positive view of the industry across a range of different government departments, agencies and other entities. The Labour Statistics for Film and Related activities data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics 2020 economic surveys indicated that about 123,290 jobs existed directly in the film industry in 2018 with a 5.3 per cent increase recorded last year.

The events industry has borne the brunt of the implications of Covid-19 to a very large extent this year. Typically one of the most lucrative industries when all factors are constant, this year has seen the demise of many money-making channels for many a stakeholder for months on end now. As we edge closer to the end of this rather turbulent year, it also looks like organizers are buoyed to slowly bring back the events lifeline slowly by slowly. Except it is also not as easy as it sounds.

A few weeks ago, the annually controversial NaiFest went down and so much flack has been meted out against them after. Questions have been asked as regards whether it is the right time to bring back showbiz or humanity should be prioritized over profits. Are there many event organizers willing to care less for the money and more for the lives of the human race? That is the million-dollar question amid the current events temperature.

Last weekend saw the last-minute cancellation of the much-awaited Mugithi in the Wild, a move that many arguably did not see coming. “It is with sincere regret that I formally inform you that, after due consideration of our current circumstances, KWS management has come to the decision to stop the planned Mugithi in the Wild event. We apologize for the inconvenience caused,’’ read a part of the statement put out by Lekishon Kenana, an official at Kenya Wildlife Service South Conservation Area division. The much-hyped event was slated for November 21 and had big headliners like Samidoh, Jose Gatutura and Kareh B, with ticket prices going for as high as Ksh10,000.

“It was devastating, to say the very least. A culmination of so many days of intense work with preparation went to the drains. It was not easy. Somewhat miraculously, people were very understanding and did not give us hell. So many people agreed that it was not our fault and had our backs. That was a really good feeling,’’ adds Shem, one of the key organizers of Mugithi in the Wild.

‘’The email from Kenya Wildlife Service was sent at 12am. Typically, no one really logs in to email at that hour. So, we only got to see the email at 8am in the morning. The shock that hit us is inexplicable. We had spent the previous night on final touches of the set, so the last-minute directive hit us rather hard. Nonetheless, we choose to focus on the bright side of things. We are already planning on a possible rescheduling and gearing up for another event, Reggae in the Wild, already. We are not slowing down anytime soon, ‘’ affirms Shem, who also doubles as a renowned corporate DJ.

What about the safety and wellness of Kenyans?

‘’We had planned on handing out face masks and hand sanitizer to every single reveller who was coming to the event. We also had a great sitting arrangement that entailed haystacks, strategically placed within intervals of 1.5 metres, as per the health ministry’s social distancing directive. When it comes to security, the location is synonymous with that. It was beefed up to the core. We were not about to make the same mistakes as others, ‘’ he boldly confirms.

Going by Shem’s statement, Mugithi in the Wild was bound to be a huge success. He insists that the rescheduled event will be even bigger and better, and with all Covid19 rules adhered to. Enter Thrift Social, which earlier in the month was postponed - the much-awaited gig headlined by award-winning South African singer and songwriter, Samthing Soweto will be going down this Sunday. This will be the first-ever post-Covid-19 edition, and suffice to say that many eyes are on them. Critics are all up in arms in case the event fails to live up to the required health restrictions. Being their first-ever post-virus to gig, what are they going to do differently? ‘’I do not want to dwell on that, seeing as my words could easily be twisted. I want to be very careful. As a matter of fact, I’d rather remain tight-lipped on any banter pertaining to Covid-19 restrictions and the event,’’ said a somewhat discreet Oliver, one of the key organizers of Thrift Social. As to how the event will pan out on Sunday, we will have to wait and see.

Meanwhile, questions abound on what the legal atmosphere hitherto looks like. What will befall those find themselves on the short end of the stick?

‘’The Public Health Rules 2020 impose a penalty of either a fine of up to KSh20,000, imprisonment for a period of up to six months, or both, for contravening the measures set out in public places: places to wash hands, social distancing and enforcement of wearing of masks and regular sanitization of the premises. This is stipulated under Rule 6. As for revellers who contract the disease because they visited a public place or attended an event, this would be a caveat emptor situation. The consumer is responsible for their actions and they cannot transfer this liability to the owner of the establishment. Unless gross negligence can be proven. Looking at the mysterious nature of the disease, that may be hard to prove as its still a medical discover the Public Health Rules 2020 impose a penalty of either a fine of up to KSh20,000, imprisonment for a period of up to six months, or both, for contravening the measures set out in public places: places to wash hands, social distancing and enforcement of wearing of masks and regular sanitization of the premises. This is stipulated under Rule 6, ‘’ informs Liz Lenjo, founder and Managing Consultant of MYIP Legal Studio. She specialises in Intellectual Property, Entertainment, Media and Fashion Law.

‘’Since March, the situation has changed. With the Government imposed restrictions the playing field can be anticipated. Now, events are being held under these guidelines.

The Raila Odinga-led party invited applications for the presidential candidacy from members of the public in January this year.

A senior accountant at the National Construction Authority (NCA) who misappropriated Sh22.7 million was given 18 years to pay back the money, a report by the Auditor General has revealed.

This was one of several red flags raised after a special audit conducted by Auditor General Nancy Gathungu following a request by the NCA board of directors in December 2017 for an investigation into the authority’s revenue, receivables and expenditure management for 2014/2015, 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 financial years.

According to the audit report, the officer was first employed as a data entry officer in May 2013. Three years later, on May 23, 2016, his request for re-designation as a senior finance officer was accepted under unclear circumstances.

One year later, he was re-designated as assistant manager finance – a position he held until he resigned on January 15, 2018. This was despite the recommendation of a disciplinary committee that the lost funds recovered from his salary over 216 months.

“There was no evidence the matter was reported to either the Directorate of Criminal Investigations or the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) for investigations and prosecution,” the report stated.

By the time the officer left, the NCA had only recovered Sh1.1 million. “The EACC should further investigate NCA management for their individual and/or collective roles in the loss of Sh22.7 million, If found culpable, the Director of Public Prosecutions should take appropriate actions, including prosecuting the culprits,” the report recommended.

The audit found that billions of shillings may have been lost at the agency due to weak internal controls. It revealed that Sh3.6 billion was recorded as a construction levy but only Sh1.8 billion could be accounted for.

The board was also found to have contravened the Mwongozo Guidelines by having 14 members instead of the recommended maximum of nine.

According to the audit, there was no evidence the agency’s budget had been approved in compliance with Section 11 (1) of the State Corporations Act. The NCA also disclosed Sh123 million as earned interest from investments, but failed to provide the source of the funds.

A total of 2,213 project registration files with contract sums totalling Sh50 billion were reviewed. Out of these, the audit found that only files with contract sums totalling Sh31 billion were properly maintained and recorded.

According to the report, Sh1.6 billion was found to be an outstanding construction levy from developers that should be recovered from the owners as a civil debt.

It was established that project developers were allowed to continue with construction even when the levy had not been fully paid.

“The special audit established that officers would give interim certificates to developers, which eventually led to the loss of revenue from levies,” the report found.

On staff recruitment, the audit revealed that 44 staff members were hired on two-year contracts without suitability interviews. Later, 41 employees were confirmed to permanent and pensionable positions without the approval of the board or the National Treasury.

Their appointments were also backdated to 2016 when they were first employed.

The audit concluded that the NCA had weak budgetary controls that could not provide efficient and effective monitoring and oversight of public funds.",Politics,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

Raila Odinga with President Uhuru Kenyatta received the BBI report at State Lodge Kisii. [Emmanuel Wanson, Standard]

The Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) appears to be back on track following days of speculation over the fate of the process.

Recent days have seen subtle political moves by allies of both President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga that appeared to suggest they were approaching the process with caution.

Statements made by ODM deputy party leader Wycliffe Oparanya and secretary general Edwin Sifuna on Tuesday appeared to fan the flames of a fire lit earlier by other Raila allies indicating all was not well in the unity pact.

But after weeks of speculation that the Handshake was shaky and BBI could fail, Raila yesterday issued a statement confirming ODM’s commitment to the Handshake with President Kenyatta and continued support for the BBI process.

The statement was issued soon after a meeting between Raila and ODM leadership at his Karen home.

Among those that attended the meeting were Siaya Senator and Senate Minority Leader James Orengo, ODM chair John Mbadi, National Assembly Minority Whip Junet Mohamed, Sifuna, ODM treasurer Timothy Bosire and Homa Bay Woman Rep Gladys Wanga. The statement now neutralises the ODM hardliners who have insisted on getting equal treatment and called out One Kenya Alliance members for trying to reap where they did not sow.

The alliance comprises NASA partners led by Musalia Mudavadi (Amani National Congress), Wiper’s Kalonzo Musyoka and Ford-Kenya’s Moses Wetang’ula. Kanu chairman Gideon Moi is also part of the newly formed coalition.

A statement by the BBI secretariat co-chaired by Junet and Dennis Waweru (Jubilee) affirming that the BBI process was still on course, however, did not have Junet’s signature.

When asked why this was the case, Junet said there was nothing out of the ordinary about the omission. “It is okay because I gave him (Waweru) approval to sign in my absence.”

The letter by Waweru sought to reassure Kenyans that everything related to BBI was still on course, even as it was claimed that the secretariat’s operations along Dennis Pritt Road had been relocated to the Office of the President (OP) at Harambee House.

Public appearance

Raila’s hours-long engagement with the party’s National Central Management Committee was his first public appearance since he tested positive for Covid-19.

Phillip Etale, the ODM director of communications, said Raila had since tested negative for the virus.

“GOD IS GOOD:@RailaOdinga has tested NEGATIVE after a third test. We thank God for this. Prayers work. Glory be to God the Almighty. Just spoken with him and he is in high spirits. He will soon bounce back. We shall rejoice together,” tweeted Etale.

Raila yesterday appealed to MPs to fast-track debate so that the BBI Bill can proceed to a referendum.

“In the spirit of the Handshake and the wider goals of the BBI Amendment Bill, we agreed on the need for Parliament to fast-track the process and release the document to the public to enable the people of Kenya to have a final say on the envisaged changes to the constitution via a referendum,” he said.

His statement came a day after his lieutenants indicated that they were throwing in the towel on the process whose referendum date is yet to be fixed.

Mbadi also confirmed that the BBI process was unstoppable, saying that once the joint Justice and Legal Affairs Committee writes its reports, the bicameral House will convene for a special sitting to deliberate on the matter this month.

“There is no stepping back. We are for the fast-tracking of the process in Parliament. We are aware of the legal challenges with the cases in court but the committee will continue with its work and table a report.

“They will hold virtual meetings and if need be, physical meeting observing social distancing. Once ready, with consultation with Majority Leader Amos Kimunya, we will request for a special sitting,” said Mbadi.

The Suba South MP argued that those that have aired divergent views about the BBI process are expressing their personal opinions, ‘which is in order since it is their democratic right’.

“We are reaffirming our position. Those are not party positions and there was no consultation on the same,” he said.

On Tuesday, Raila’s confidants led by Oparanya and Sifuna sent a message that all was not well with the initiative that the outfit has championed for the last three years.

The two, in separate events, said that priority should be placed on fighting Covid-19 pandemic rather than the BBI.

Sifuna said President Kenyatta should focus on containing Covid-19 so that Kenyans can return to their normal lives.

“If you don’t have original ideas just copy what the other countries are doing. Focus on giving people support and ramp up vaccination, but if there’s a single shilling that was going to BBI we can now use it to buy vaccine,” he saidin a TV interview.

Sifuna said he supported the break until May by the Senate and National Assembly “so as to focus on more important current issues especially the third wave of Covid-19.”

But Oparanya was more categorical that the country did not have the capacity to conduct a referendum and General Election in a span of one year and called for the suspension of the process.

The journey of the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020, popularly known as BBI Bill, is nearly complete after a task force led by the late Garissa Senator Yusuf Haji collected and validated views.

On March 4, the BBI Bill was introduced into the National Assembly and the Senate after 43 county assemblies passed it.

Avoid referendum

But the request by President Kenyatta for the suspension of parliamentary operations days before a report on the Bill’s public participation by a joint parliamentary committee on Justice was tabled has left a cloud of uncertainty hanging over the process.

During the 15th address on coronavirus pandemic last Friday, President Kenyatta directed that with the concurrence of the parliamentary leadership of both houses of Parliament, and with the concurrence of county leadership; the ordinary sessions of the August Houses including those of their committees, and the ordinary sessions of the county assemblies of Nairobi, Machakos, Kajiado, Kiambu and Nakuru be suspended until further notice.

There is an argument that a group of politicians and strategists around the president believe that the referendum should be avoided, and some of the bills passed by Parliament and signed by Uhuru as law.

The reasoning is informed by the fact that the country has been ravaged economically by the Covid-19 pandemic and distracted by the 2022 succession politics.

“The group believes that even if the referendum is won, the turnout will be very low thus likely to embarrass the proponents,” said a top Jubilee party official.

The directive to halt parliamentary operations jolted the joint committee that was on the verge of completing a report on public participation ahead of tabling it in both the National Assembly and Senate.

ODM leader Raila Odinga is poised to make his fifth stab at the presidency come the 2022 General Election.

The Standard has reliably learnt that Raila handed in his application for the ODM presidential ticket to the National Election Board (NEB).

Sources said the ODM leader will battle it out for the party ticket with his two deputies, governors Wycliffe Oparanya and Hassan Joho.

This ends speculation over Raila’s plan for 2022 elections. He was on the ballot in 1997, 2007, 2013 and 2017 elections.

This could be Raila’s final bullet in the race to the “House on the Hill’ if the National Executive Council (NEC) and the National Delegates Conference (NDC) endorse his candidature.

“Raila has submitted his papers. He is among the three applicants that the NEB has received their applications. Others are governors Joho and Oparanya. This falls in the mandate of the NEB and therefore they will make it public,” said a senior party official who declined to be named.

Another leader stated: “The NEB will deliberate on the applicants, vet and come up with a report to be tabled before NEC. The board can decided to submit one name or the three. The board will then set a date for the NDC where members will endorse the candidate.”

Yesterday was the deadline for submission of applications by aspirants eyeing the position after it was postponed last month.

Raila chaired the Central Management Committee meeting at his Karen residence yesterday, being the first public engagement since he tested positive for Covid-19.

He reportedly used the meeting to announce his Covid-19 negative status and resolved to keep a low profile and observe health protocols.

Joho was the first to submit his application to NEB on February 26.

Spearheaded campaigns

In the application whose copy The Standard has seen, the deputy ODM party leader argued that he is best suited to fly the party’s flag in the next polls having grown from a young Turk in the party.

In his nine-paged submission, Joho argued that: “Even in 2017, I spearheaded the Mombasa County ODM presidential campaigns. The overwhelming number of votes garnered by the party leader from our county evince my efforts.”

He added, “I was also instrumental in our party leaders ’22-stop Pwani tour’, which culminated in the mega rally at the Tononoka grounds where Raila was endorsed by the coastal region as its presidential candidate.”

Joho while pitching his candidature for the presidency said that he has stood with Raila even during the mock swearing-in ceremony at Uhuru Park on January 30, 2018.

The Mombasa governor’s application comes amidst the push to form a Coast party.

Oparanya said he was planning to submit his papers.

In an interview with The Standard NEB chairperson Catherine Mumma said that her office was yet to receive the names of those who had expressed interest in flying the party’s flag in next year’s poll.

“It is the secretariat to inform me of all the applications. I have not received a report from them but I am waiting for one before the end of the day,” Prof Mumma said yesterday.

Those interested in being ODM’s presidential candidates are required to submit Sh1 million as a registration fee and must be life members of the party. They must also have been ODM members for one year and be degree holders.

There were reports that some party members were not enthusiastic about trying their luck for the ODM ticket given that Raila was largely perceived as the predetermined candidate.

Political observers agree that the ODM leader’s candidature had been a long time coming. Prof Amukoa Anangwe, a former lecturer of political science at the University of Dodoma said he was not surprised by the move.

“That was anticipated, notwithstanding that the party’s elections board had left it open and he might eventually end up becoming their candidate,” said Anangwe.

Prof Karuti Kanyinga and Prof Philip Nying’uro also shared the sentiments.

The ODM leader had, in the recent past, committed to putting off his presidential ambitions until the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) process was done and dusted.

This, he had said, was part of his agreement with President Uhuru Kenyatta that they would keep 2022 politics out of their engagements within their Handshake partnership.

Raila’s declaration of interest to succeed President Kenyatta contravenes that stand.

The 2022 race is now shaping up after Deputy President William Ruto declared that his quest for the presidency is unstoppable.

On the other, the entry of the One Kenya Alliance – comprising Raila’s former allies in the NASA coalition Kalonzo Musyoka, Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang’ula, and Kanu Chairman Gideon Moi – raised the stakes for next year’s race.

Raila, all the while, had been campaigning for constitutional amendments through the BBI. He had increasingly faced more pressure from his inner circle to vie for the presidency.

Recent political activity, however, shows that the president may be backing the One Kenya Alliance. The involvement of the One Kenya Alliance leaders in the BBI has made ODM jittery.

The new alliance has seemingly boxed Raila and Ruto in one corner, with observers hinting at the two forging an alliance. The DP recently said that he was ready to work with the ODM leader.

If he secures the ODM ticket, Raila may be faced with the dilemma of having to choose his political friends as he has declared that he would not endorse any of the NASA principals citing their decision to snub his mock swearing-in in 2018.

The ODM leader’s plan to vie for the presidency also comes amidst a growing push from his inner circle to have the BBI process set aside.

On Tuesday, Oparanya and ODM Secretary General Edwin Sifuna separately suggested that the cash meant for the BBI drive be channeled to procuring Covid-19 vaccines.

This comes after Raila allies accused top government officials of scheming to undermine the BBI process.

In a statement yesterday, the ODM leader said that he was still committed to seeing the BBI report passed.

“The meeting reaffirmed ODM’s commitment to the spirit of the Handshake with President Uhuru Kenyatta that has created an environment of peace and stability required to address the pressing issues facing the country. We tasked the party and our supporters to continue showing this commitment…” the statement read in part.

In an interview on Citizen TV, Wiper leader Kalonzo said that Raila was welcome to the One Kenya Alliance and rejected claims that they were out to hijack the BBI.

Raila’s intention to run for the presidency, experts contend, may have implications in the political space.

Prof Kanyinga said Raila’s relationship with the president may not change in light of his ambitions, despite making an assurance to shelve his 2022 dreams.

“It does not affect his relationship with the President. With nearly 15 months to the elections, it must have dawned on him that the elections are close. It may, however, change a lot of how they proceed with the BBI going forward,” he said

In as far as his relationship with his NASA allies goes, Kanyinga said that interests change and that his change of heart regarding his promise to pave the way for one of the principals was typical of the political class.

“His declaration makes no difference in his relationship with NASA since it has been dead and all the principals have said as much. It, however, makes a difference in the implementation of the BBI since ODM has been making mixed signals,” said Anangwe.

Strained relationship

He, however, believes that Raila’s promise to tone down on 2022 politics was meant to calm the nerves of those who thought he would use it to fuel his presidential bid. Anangwe said the ODM leader’s candidature, could create a three-horse race scenario in next year’s race.

Nying’uro, on his part, opined that Raila’s relationship with the president is already strained and his entry in the presidential race was aimed at thwarting the chances of the One Kenya Alliance.

“One Kenya can only survive with the additional posts proposed by the BBI. ODM is retreating from the BBI as a way of scuttling One Kenya. The party is now working towards 2022 with the understanding that Uhuru left them,” said Prof Nying’uro.

He further suggests that ODM’s decision to keep the nomination of its presidential candidate open may have been a plan to identify moles within the party and Raila’s formal interest may have been as a result of looming danger.

“We must tie this to the ‘men in black’ incident of 2014 when several moles were identified… The extension of the deadline may have exposed some of them,” he added.",Politics,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

ODM Leader Raila Odinga asserts that the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) must go through a referendum.

Raila surfaced in a meeting with the Party's top leadership since he took time off after contracting the coronavirus, more than a fortnight ago.

“We agreed that the BBI must be subjected to a referendum because it entails a fundamental reorganization of the architecture of the Executive and Kenyans need to have a say in the reorganization. The party therefore fully supports a referendum on the document,” Raila said.

The former Prime Minister also avers that the National Assembly needs to hasten the process and release the document to the public. This, he says will enable Kenyans to have a final say on the proposed changes in the Constitutional of Kenya Amendment Bill, 2020 through a referendum.

His sentiments come a day after ODM Deputy Party leader Wycliffe Oparanya signaled the likely collapse of the BBI Bill.

Governor Oparanya is of the idea that a referendum would be costly for a country gearing up for General elections in 2022, amid the harsh economic times occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic.

Last week, it emerged that some ODM MPs were divided over the push to effect amendments to the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020 in Parliament.

Parliament yesterday adjourned its sittings as a containment measure against the Covid-19 pandemic currently in its third wave.

The National Assembly approved the motion to suspend its regular sessions till May 4th May at 2.30pm, while the Senate will resume on May 11th inline with the President's directive to mitigate against the spread of the virus whose daily positivity rate is more than 26 percent.

Senate Majority Leader Senator Samuel Poghisio and the Majority leader Amos Kimunya yesterday moved a motion in their respective Houses to alter the calendar for the Firth Session.

Kimunya even informed the House that the joint Justice and Legal Affairs Committee (JLAC) sittings were suspended last week after some members turned Covid-19 positive and went into isolation.

But National Assembly JLAC vice-chairman disagreed with Kimunya's assertions on the Health Status of the BBI team members. The committee was expected to table its report on April 1st.

“As a House, we not only do it to protect ourselves but as a sign of leadership to other levels of government,” said Kimunya.

The current session was supposed to go till the end of April and a one-month recess to be taken from April 7.

He argued, “It makes more sense to bring forward the long recess. We take it now so we come back when we should have been going for recess and transact the business that will be before us and within a safe environment.""

The charged House took issue with the President's directive, with MPs insisting that they are independent and can only make their own alterations of the calendar.

Just like last year, parliament has planned to ensure that public participation on budget and departmental committees which takes place during the May recess will be conducted virtually.

Even though the chamber is suspended, committees will continue meeting in order to see through ""urgent business that comes inside the house"" such as the BBI and the County Allocation of Revenue Bill (CARB), 2020.

""Immediately we live today, committee meeting will be taking place and you will be expected to be in Nairobi, in your office although the meetings will take place virtually,"" said Kimunya.?

Minority Leader John Mbadi supported the motion stating that members in committees should ensure they transact their duties from the office to avoid interference from informal areas such as homes.

“If you are not going to be available in the office, ask for permission from your Chair,” said Mbadi.

Speaker Justin Muturi sought to set the record straight on why they had to alter the House calendar and not as per the President's directive, which was supposed to be indefinite.

""For Parliament, we cannot be suspended. We cannot be adjourned or directed to adjourn except as we desire through our own resolutions. I wish to make certain clarifications. I am aware that the business appearing on Order No. 13 is a result of certain exigencies that have happened in the country and certain communications that may have been issued,"" said Muturi.

he went on, "" I reminded members of the need to shield MPs from Covid-19, which is not new, and that House proceedings will not be affected. The true position is this, that a meeting was called at State House, at which all the three arms of government were represented for consultation and briefing on updates on the latest Covid-19 pandemic situation in the country.""

He disclosed, ""After listening to the Health professional, led by the Director of Health, the three arms of government and the Inter-religious Council representatives at that meeting took certain decision. Ordinarily, when consultations of that nature do happen, certain statements follow.""

Muturi said he advice then that with regards to what happens in the houses of Parliament, he said the houses of Parliament representatives and leadership there should have merely been requested to take note of the brief.

Unfortunately, he revealed, ""As maybe some of you will know, not everybody understands the language of Parliament.""

He added, ""But of course, members, there are some overenthusiastic people who do not always understand some of those things, even as we debate this motion, we must bear in mind that it is you, as members, who have the ultimate responsibility, duty and authority to determine how you would want to regulate yourselves...even in the current upsurge in the Covid-19 pandemic.""

Senate, on its part, resolved to adjourn until May 11th with committees also allowed to carry on with virtual sittings with the option for physical sittings when necessary.

President Kenyatta said in his Covid-19 update address to the nation last Friday said in consultation with the speakers of the bicameral Parliament, the august house would suspend its sittings.

Several senators were opposed to the president’s directive, and a subsequent communication by Speaker Kenneth Lusaka during yesterday’s morning sitting seemed to align with it.

Speaker Lusaka was on the spot for his communication that senators felt had been an extension of the president’s directive.

“The speaker’s communication was like a directive. The speaker’s powers are very limited. The House makes decisions and resolutions in plenary,” said Minority Leader James Orengo who at the same time underscored the need for taking necessary precaution.

The Siaya senator had proposed that senators take weekly Covid-19 tests to ensure their safety during the sittings.

Vihiga Senator George Khaniri also faulted President Uhuru’s action, saying he had no such powers.

“We passed the constitution 2010 to ensure that Parliament has its independence. We can decide when to sit and when not to. All three arms are independent of each other,” said Khaniri.

He went on “We are happy to adjourn but we must continue working… as Senator Khaniri said, the executive is still working,” said Narok Senator Ledama ole Kina, adding that virtual committee sittings were critical in oversight.

“The calendar of Parliament cannot be amended and discussed in any other meeting,” said Kericho Senator Aaron Cheruiyot, who also bashed the Speaker for his communication.

Senate had been sitting from Tuesday to Thursday until last week when they resolved to reduce their sitting days to one, every Wednesday.

ODM has sent signals that it may abandon the quest for the review of the Constitution through the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI).

In a statement yesterday, top ODM officials told the government to use the funds set aside for the referendum to fight the Covid-19 pandemic.

Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya, who is the deputy party leader, and ODM Secretary General Edwin Sifuna said the funds for the impending plebiscite “should be channelled to better use”.

As ODM threw the spanner in the works in the BBI process, the party also tightened its screws on its erstwhile partners Amani National Congress (ANC), Wiper and Ford-Kenya, accusing them of trying to rock the handshake so that they can benefit from it.

National Assembly Minority Whip Junet Mohammed described ANC as a greedy hyena sitting somewhere with hopes that ODM abandons the Handshake.

“From today if we don’t get the respect we deserve from those small parties, we will deal with them in the only way we can as ODM,” said Mr Junet, without giving details.

But it was Mr Oparanya and Mr Sifuna's statement that signalled the likelihood of the BBI collapsing midstream as the partners wrangle.

Oparanya said the much hyped referendum, seen as the brainchild of President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga, and which was key in cementing their legacy, should be deferred.

“If there is no money at the National Treasury, there is no need of pushing to have the referendum this year. We should plan to hold the referendum next year when our economy has stabilised and Covid-19 has been contained,” said the governor, a close ally of Raila.

And speaking on Citizen TV earlier in the day, Sifuna appeared to be reading from the same script with Oparanya when he said Uhuru should focus on containing Covid-19 so that Kenyans could return to normal lives.

“If you don’t have original ideas just copy what the other countries are doing. Focus on giving people support and ramp up vaccination,” Sifuna said, adding that Kenyans were suffering due to effects of Covid-19.

Sifuna said no money was being spent on BBI, “but if there’s a single shilling that was going to BBI. We can now use it to buy vaccine”.

“We should focus on measures that can assuage the economic situation"" said Sifuna, adding that Kenyans were tired of “consultations and stories” and needed tangible efforts to cushion them.

He later told The Standard: “Both the Senate and National Assembly have taken a break until the month of May, while they were the ones to discuss the BBI report.

""This means Parliament has already pushed the BBI matter further so as to focus on more important current issues, especially the third wave of Covid-19. Thats the same thing we support.”

But Junet said the BBI process remained on, warning that ODM would not allow smaller parties to hijack it.

“They (the other parties) should know that ODM is here to stay. ODM is the one that made handshake with the President and we will support BBI to the end. There are small parties that think they can push us out of the BBI process,” said Junet.

“How do you walk out of your project? ODM is in BBI and we will not walk out. These small parties are like hyena following a man with hopes that his hand falls down for them to eat.”

But ANC deputy party leader Ayub Savula and Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala described ODM’s action as “kicks of a dying horse”.

The MPs said ANC was already in a working relationship with the president and are determined to work towards the formation of the next government.

Malala said the BBI document now belongs to the people and not to a political party, while daring ODM to abandon it if they feel sidelined.

“As ANC we will continue working with the president to promote the BBI. You have seen they have started to threaten to abandon the BBI. We want to tell ODM that BBI belongs to the people of Kenya,” he said.

The turmoil over BBI comes as disquiet continued in the ODM strongholds over perceived President Kenyatta’s isolation of Raila in the 2022 succession matrix, with some of former PM's lieutenants saying they had backed the BBI in the hope that Uhuru would back the ODM leader for presidency.

Siaya Senator James Orengo was the first to raisethe red flag over some Harambee House mandarins he accused of interfering with running of BBI affairs and planning to wreck Raila’s presidential bid.

Uhuru has been meeting regional political kingpins and was said to be favouring one of One Kenya Alliance leaders to succeed him in 2022.

One Kenya Alliance comprises ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi, Ford-Kenya’s Moses Wetang'ula, Wiper’s Kalonzo Musyoka and Kanu Chairman Gideon Moi.

Political observers believe the alliance was meant to isolate Raila and Deputy President William Ruto ahead of next year's elections.

ODM has also cried foul over the conduct of Matungu parliamentary by-election that was won by an ANC candidate, accusing Interior Ministry officials of condoning violence during the poll.

The emerging war between the Handshake partners and former National Super Alliance leaders has reduced the momentum for the push for BBI, with ODM brigade insisting Raila had been short-changed.

Leaders from Raila’s Nyanza base and Western have expressed concerns over ""few"" additional constituencies the areas are to benefit from if BBI is passed and implemented.

Raila initially blamed the low number of electoral areas allocated to the regions to a hitch during printing of the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill 2020.

Oparanya’s sentiments yesterday signalled the ODM bigwigs could have abandoned the BBI and the push for a referendum.

He said the third wave of Covid-19 was posing a serious danger to the lives of Kenyans and all the resources and energy should be put on containing the spread of the deadly virus.

The governor added that the economic crisis the country was facing was a clear indication that holding a referendum would be a tall order. He suggested that the plebiscite be pushed forward until things clears up.

Oparanya spoke in his office when he hosted Finance and Planning Chief Administrative Secretary Eric Wafukho.

Wafukho was in the county to supervise the ongoing Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) examination.

The governor said Covid-19 containment measures put in place by President Kenyatta will hinder referendum campaigns.

“It is a requirement that public awareness about the document should be done and politicians will be conducting the exercise through public meetings. This cannot work in the current state of affairs when the country is busy dealing with the challenges of Covid-19,” Oparanya said.

He said there was no need of pressurising the National Treasury to release funds for a referendum while Covid-19 continues to claim lives of innocent Kenyans.

“Funds that are being set aside to finance referendum should be disbursed to counties for Covid-19 preparedness and provision of medical care to those who contract the virus,” Oparanya said.

The governor also urged the president to negotiate with international financial lenders to defer debts owed by Kenya for at least two years to enable the country meet its domestic financial obligations.

“If the international organisations that Kenya owes money allow the State to defer paying their loans we would be saving between Sh800 billion and Sh1 trillion per year, which is enough to help us recover from the current economic crisis,” he said.

But political analysts believe this could just be another tactical retreat by ODM and Raila.

Last week, the joint parliamentary Justice and Legal Affairs Committee was given 14 days to finalise and table its report on the BBI Bill.

This came a few days after National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi said it was to be tabled on the floor of the House in 10 days instead of the 14 that it had sought.

The Bill was birthed through Raila's Handshake with Uhuru.

There has been discontent among a section of leaders from Nyanza who have argued that the region was given a raw deal.

Raila has taken a low profile on politics in the past few weeks as he recovers from Covid-19. Despite having raised queries about the micromanaging of the BBI secretariat, Raila’s foot soldiers too have gone slow on championing the passage of the Bill.

Proponents of the Bill from Nyanza have also either gone mute or changed tune on the BBI.

Migori Governor Okoth Obado at the weekend said Kenyans should not be cheated that if passed and implemented, BBI will make life easier. He said life will instead become harder and the narrative the Bill would make life easy was a big lie.

“Reggae rhythms can no longer be heard clearly,” he said.

“It looks like there is a cockroach that has got into one of the wires and the system cannot produce good sound.”

The county boss said the Bill itself was bad and would raise the cost of running government.

https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/standard-entertainment/article/2001407691/lovy-longomba-on-life-and-death-of-a-brother,EXCLUSIVE: Lovy Longomba tells all on his return to Kenya after fifteen years,"Former secular musician Lovy Longomba, during an interview on March 26, 2021, at Palacina Hotel in Nairobi. [Edward Kiplimo, Standard]

We are seated in a room decorated with soft natural light and the orange-hued portrait of a black elephant at the Palacina Hotel, just off Dennis Pritt Road in Nairobi.

The room itself is like a Rubik’s Cube, off a reception outside a restaurant with a palisade that oversees a splash of plants that bespeak paleobotany.

Inside the room, Lovy Longomba, like some feudal-musical lord long lost in Los Angeles, the overall impression of a palantine added to by the presence of three muscular guys in the room (one of them, Sammy, who used to be the non-ominous but omnipresent around Redsan), fleeting in-and-out of the room – as if attending to some unspoken business/crisis on a higher floor of the Palacina.

Lovy has grown in both girth and stature since I last saw him 16 years ago at the 2005 Kora Awards, where his brother, Christian, and himself as The Longombaz won in the ‘Best Group in East Africa’ category – riding on a long wave of hit singles starting with Dondosa to Piga Makofi, Shika Mo and Vuta Pumz.

Christian breathed his last in a Los Angeles hospital on March 13 this year.

Lovy seems taller than I remember, but maybe that’s because of the fitting suit, creamy orange like an ice-cream bouffant (same colour as the painted elephant background). His shoes gleam. He wears a gold watch, gold bracelet, golden crucifix and a gold chain against his black polo neck.

“It is said that the streets of heaven are paved with gold,” he quips. Lovy is now a Christian minister in California, with his own ‘Church of Revelations.’

“So if you don’t like gold, you are going straight to hell,” I joke.

Lovy smiles slightly, his eyes hidden behind designer sunglasses. Later, when he removes them, there will be a sheen of sadness and sensitivity there, for his gone brother. “We were born into a musical bloodline,” Lovy says. “Our father was Lovy Longomba. Our uncle is Awilo Longomba, who became world-famous for a while.”

He speaks of growing up in a 1990s where Congolese music was all the rage – the Longombas themselves being Congolese who had long resettled in Kenya.

“Christian and I went with my Dad, Lovy Longomba Senior, everywhere as children, as he performed with Mangelepe. Congolese lingala music, benga, tunes from TZ. This was the thing.”

His face lights up as he speaks of young memories at Makuti and Deep West clubs in Nairobi. “We lived in South C. Near wakina Big Pin and E-Sir. You are a Nairobi West guy, yes? So you knew Deep West and Makuti.”

Having mentioned E-Sir, Lovy goes back to that ‘Rainbow’ period of 2002-2006, when Kenyans even made it to the Top Ten of ‘most optimistic people in the world,’ before the tribal politics and bungled election of 2007 turned into the post-election violence of 2008.

Boomba Train

And the Boomba Train derailed, secular music shrunk and shrivelled, and things went South (South African music), then West (Naija music) before coming back East – only to settle in the belly of the beast, or rather the ‘bongo’ of Tanzanian music, which loathed ‘Kenyanese.’

Boomba, pioneered by E-Sir in the early 2000s, was the sunrise of what I call the Golden Age of the New 21st Century popular music in Kenya. Nameless was a key player at the centre. Then came people like K-Rupt and girls like Tatu (Angela Mwadanda, Angela Ndambuki and Debbie Asila) with groups like Klepto for kapuka; and then Nonini and Jua Cali with the first genge wave.

Lovy talks about how Lucas at Ogopa DJs and Clemmo at Calif Records were key figures in making that first-ever wave of ‘celebrity culture’ work, alongside magazines like Pulse and radio Djs like Shaffie Weru. “It was just a fresh, exciting and experimental era,” Lovy reminisces. “There was hard work to be done in the studio, but musicians did it with joy, and we were all a big new ‘celebrity’ family ....”

Lovy, though, had always seen music as a birthright that he would give seven years to, then get on with what he considered his key life mission–not as ‘musician but as a Minister of God.’ (A joke about MoG by me flies past his ear and out of the window).

In 2006, Lovy left Kenya, and a year later, his brother joined him in Los Angeles. “I always regarded music purely as art and entertainment, whereas Christian saw it as talent and development. Christian was more in love with the music, and I, Lovy, more the Christian.”

But that did not stop Lovy, with help from his brother, from going into production in the US, getting into the system, and doing production work on projects by top musicians like Akon TIA, Mr Vegas and even Justin Bieber.

By 2013, with backing from people like a UFC Octagon legend fighter called Jones, Lovy was ready to make the move into his own ministry.

It is time to move the interview on to darker, more tragic waters.

“One day in 2015, when I was in Houston on duty, I was called and told to fly back to LA (Los Angeles) immediately, because my brother had had a terrible seizure.”

In hospital, it turned out Christian had a large tumour in his brain and he had to undergo surgery. “If you do this surgery, bro,” Lovy whispered to his brother in a hospital bed, “you may not survive it.”

“Damned if I do, doomed if I don’t!” Christian said. Then they prayed. The surgery was done and the tumor removed. For the next two years, other than severe headaches, Christian seemed okay.

Like a line from a Placebo song: “The cancer becomes malign/ but my brother’s doing fine.” But by 2018, the seizures were growing in frequency and violence. By 2019, even his sight was getting affected.

“But Christian was a real spiritual warrior,” Lovy says. “He took tons of medicines, but never complained. He was a cheerful guy to the very end. He was very amused by those singers called Sailors and their ‘Wamlambez? Wamnyonyez’.” ‘Genge tone,’ Lovy says, is a flavour of “real” Kenyan music.

Except that when he went to hospital this last time, Christian told Lovy he was so tired of the in-and-out of the hospital stays: “Maybe it is time I went home ....”

Christian’s last wish had been to do an Easter trip to Kenya, to “come home.” Now Lovy is here, alone – but for the love and sympathy of an entire country.

A damp evening breeze blows through the window of the Rubik’s Cube room in the Palacina. “You know,” Lovy says. “I don’t remember Nairobi being this humid. It’s a bit like being in Mombasa.”

It has been 16 years. A lot can change in that time. What we listen to! Even the weather.

Six nominated Jubilee senators allied to Deputy President William Ruto are on the verge of having their seats declared vacant.

Yesterday, the Registrar of Political Parties Anne Nderitu told The Standard that her office has kicked off the process of striking off the names of the expelled senators from Jubilee membership roll.

Ms Nderitu said that having received communication on the party’s resolution to kick out the errand members from Jubilee Secretary General Raphael Tuju, her office has begun to review the procedure followed in expelling the members. She said the office has about three days to make a decision, while hinting that it could be as soon as today.

Conservatory orders

“We received Jubilee’s communication this morning. We are reviewing it before we can communicate our decision, which will be done within three days,” said Nderitu.

President Uhuru Kenyatta’s side in the ruling Jubilee has expelled nominated senators Isaac Mwaura, Millicent Omanga, Mary Seneta, Falhada Dekow, Naomi Waqo and Victor Prengei for associating with Deputy President William Ruto.

The letter by Jubilee was submitted to the Office of the registrar and the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC).

Should the registrar strike off the names from the party’s membership list, Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka will declare the six seats vacant. This will consequently pave way for IEBC to start the process of replacing the fired senators.

On Friday, the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal declined to issue orders barring the registrar from removing Mwaura’s name from the membership of Jubilee Party.

They errand members, however, are free to move to the High Court if they are not satisfied with the registrar’s decision. And in the event that the High Court also upholds the party decision, they would still have the right to proceed to the Court of Appeal and finally the Supreme Court.

Ruto’s allies have already indicated that they will battle their removal to the bitter end.

Soy MP Caleb Kositany said they would go up to the Supreme Court to challenge the decision even as he expressed confidence that the senators would serve their full term.

“There’s no way they can nominate from outside the list that is with the IEBC. But even before we get there, we are going to exploit the appeal mechanism provided for in law,” said Mr Kositany.

He added: “I can tell you the senators will serve their term to the end. They have done no wrong. It is just victimisation.”

Already, Uhuru is facing a headache in replacing the six nominated senators, as some of their potential replacements are allies of DP Ruto.

United Democratic Alliance (UDA) Secretary General Veronica Maina is among top names in a closed party list filed with the IEBC, making her an automatic pick should the six lose their seats.

Article 98 of the Constitution requires political parties to nominate 16 women, according to the proportion of members of the Senate elected, and two other nominees being one man and one woman, representing the youth, one man and one woman representing persons with disabilities.

Priority set out

The lists apply according to the priority set out by political parties, implying that the higher a candidate is on the list of their respective political parties, the higher their chances of being nominated.

Therefore, should the party effect the ouster, the six will be replaced by Caroline Daudi (Machakos), Veronica Maina (Murang’a), Francisca Kamuren (Nakuru) and Beatrice Gambo (Coast).

Senator Mwaura, who was picked to represent persons with disability, would be replaced by Joyce Amasong, who is listed under the same category while Senator Prengei, who represents the youth, will be replaced by Peris Wambui from Murang’a.",Politics,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

A week after they had a session with President Uhuru Kenyatta, Coast governors yesterday held a meeting heightening the talks of formation of a regional party.

Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya hosted governors Amason Kingi of Kilifi and Hassan Joho of Mombasa at his office as it emerged that Kingi was ready to launch his party.

The three governors held a meeting with President Kenyatta last Wednesday at State House in Nairobi, where insiders say the president was keen to have them work together under a regional party.

According to MPs from the region, this is a strategy by President Kenyatta to block Deputy President William Ruto from the region.

Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) Raila Odinga is likely to be a big casualty of Uhuru’s move to encourage the region to have an outfit representing them in national politics.

And yesterday, the meeting with the governors heightened talks, with Kilifi governor expected to launch his revamped Kadu Asili party over the weekend.

“We met as leaders from the neighbouring counties and as leaders with a common interest of uplifting the lives of our people.

“This should not be looked at through political lens,” said Kingi.

During the tour of the Coast region to market the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI), Raila was told by Kingi that their time to form the regional party was long overdue.

He added that they would go ahead with the outfit that would carry the aspirations of the six counties.

Raila has discouraged the region from going the regional party route, claiming that the idea was outdated and those pushing for it were falling into the trap of tribalism.

The meeting yesterday, a source said, was part of trying to bring the leaders together as it emerged that Joho was still pushing for ODM’s dominance while Mvurya, who is a confidant of DP, has been cagey on his next political move.

Nyali MP Mohamed Ali said the meeting by the three governors was not a representation of the region but their attempts to secure their future as their terms come to an end.

Raila enjoyed huge support from the region in the 2007 to 2013 general elections and the latest development could distabilise his base.

Sources said the three governors discussed how they would push for the support of BBI, the possibility of Coast forming a party or coalition and how to promote the Jumuiya ya Kaunti za Pwani (JKP) economic bloc.

Joho said: “Earlier this morning, together with my brother Amason Kingi, we paid a courtesy call on Salim Mvurya at his offices in Kwale.”

Governor Kingi said: “With my brothers Hon Ali Hassan Joho and Governor Salim Mvurya in Kwale County today.”

“The bigger picture is that the president wants the BBI to pass and he has been lobbying the governors to back his agenda,” said Pwani University lecturer Hassan Mwakimako.

He, however, added that the governors could have talked about the controversial plan to form a Coast political party or coalition since the BBI emphasises on the need for representation.

“The BBI is also about representation and I hope this was on the list of the governors agenda for the meeting,” he added.

Prof Halim Shauri also said the three governors must be pursuing the BBI agenda since the president has a lot of interest in the initiative investing so much in it.

“The president must have asked the governors to prepare for the BBI and ensure it receives massive support in the Coast region.

“This is because he has invested a lot in it and will leave no stone unturned,” Prof Shauri said.

The three governors have kept their political cards close to their chests since they met President Kenyatta in Nairobi.

Their aides said yesterday they stayed out of the meeting whose agenda was yet to be disclosed.

Daniel Nyassy, the Kwale County director of communications said he was not in the meeting yesterday.

Mark Agutu, the Kilifi communications director also said he was not privy to the issues raised in the meeting and that the agenda has not been made public.

Uhuru’s hosting of the governors, according to one of the county bosses who was in the meeting, was to have them fast-track formation of the regional party that would work closely with One Kenya Alliance.

The One Kenya Alliance brings together party leaders Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Musalia Mudavadi (Amani National Congress), Baringo Senator Gideon Moi of Kanu and Moses Wetang’ula (Ford Kenya).",Politics,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

The notice signed by RPP Ann Nderitu said it is awaiting the adoption of the same by the National Executive Committee.

The RPP based its decision on the party disciplinary committee report dated February 6 as well as the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal ruling on March 26.

The act of the registrar striking off a name from a party’s membership list means Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka will declare the seat vacant. This will then pave way for IEBC to start the process of replacing the fired senator.

Nomination lists from political parties submitted to the IEBC before the General Election are closed and, therefore, the concerned party cannot nominate other people outside the list.

“IEBC will pick from the party list and Gazette notice just the same way the registrar will do on the changes. It is within the rights of the nominees to vacate their nomination or be nominated, despite being in breach of the requirements like gender and regional balance,” said a senior official at the office of the registrar.

Affected members, however, are free to move to the High Court if they are not satisfied with the registrar’s decision. And in the event that the High Court also upholds the party decision, they would still have the right to proceed to the Court of Appeal and finally the Supreme Court.

Mwaura's troubles started on February 8, 2021, when Jubilee Party settled on expelling nominated Senators over disciplinary violations.

Others are Mary Seneta, Falhada Dekow Iman, Naomi Jillo Waqo, Victor Prengei, Millicent Omanga and Christine Gona. They were expelled by the National Management Committee (NMC) after deliberating on the reports submitted by the Party Disciplinary Committee.

Mwaura was accused of advancing the ideologies of United Democratic Alliance (UDA) alongside the DP and other Tangatanga MPs.

According to a statement signed by Party Secretary-General Raphael Tuju, the six had appeared before the disciplinary committee last year and this year over insubordination and gross misconduct.

“The NMC in exercising its mandate as provided for under Article 7(2a) of the party constitution and relying on other enabling provisions of the same constitution has expelled the senators,” read the statement.",Politics,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua has criticised the government for what she termed as misguided decisions.

She said the cessation of movement in five counties imposed by President Uhuru Kenyatta last Friday will only create more suffering for Kenyans without any tangible benefits.

Karua faulted the government for its failure to consult citizens and the business community before pronouncing policies that affect people’s lives.

“We are greatly aggrieved that the Jubilee administration did not outline any measures to address these hardship realities as they announced the lockdown,” said Karua.

She noted that the first lockdown last year resulted in harsh economic realities whose effects are still being felt across different sectors.

Speaking at the party headquarters in Nairobi yesterday, Karua faulted the president and other top political leaders, saying they were also to blame for the increased Covid-19 infections following mass political rallies popularising the Building Bridges Initiative and the recent by-elections in different regions.

“Kenyans will recall that a majority of citizens zealously observed the Covid-19 protocols and that it is the top political players who led their supporters into mass rallies in total disregard of Covid-19 protocols,” said Karua.

A critic of the Jubilee administration, Karua is now demanding that the government, among other things, takes up the cost of testing Covid-19 in its facilities, intensify the vaccination process and enhance capacity in all county hospitals for testing and response to the critically ill.

“The government should immediately provide food subsidies and expanded transfers to the vulnerable, and fast track investigations and prosecutions in the Covid-19 related corruption as a way of building trust,” she said.

Karua has also called on the government to institute taxation measures to cushion citizens and businesses from the adverse economic effects of the lockdown similar to what was done at the beginning of the pandemic last year.

“While almost all of the top political leaders are on government salary or stipend, the ordinary citizens are on their own to face the stark realities of the lockdown and shoulder the burden of its brutal economic consequences,” said Karua.",Politics,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

Women leaders across Nyanza are rolling up their sleeves as they seek to increase their political representation ahead of next year’s elections.

And as they build a campaign war chest to challenge the domination of men in the region’s politics, the women are lamenting over, among others, the lack of resources to compete fairly with their male counterparts.

Some women politicians have pointed to the culture that favours men as another major limiting factor for them. Others have also raised concerns over intimidation by male politicians and their supporters, especially around election time.

The leaders say they are seeking to end the gender disparity that has been evident in Nyanza politics over the years and have more women take up elective seats.

Save for a few women who have won the MP's seat and that of Woman Representative, a special post reserved by the constitution for a woman holder, governor and senatorial posts have eluded them since the advent of devolution in 2013.

Last elections

Only one woman has made an attempt for the governor's post in Kisumu that has been held by Jack Ranguma and his successor and current governor Anyang' Nyong’o. Christine Atieno of Jubilee contested against ODM’s Nyong’o in the last elections. She finished third behind Ranguma.

Not even negotiated democracy and consensus by ODM, the most dominant party in the region, have helped women candidates.

Subscribe to Our Newsletter Subscribe to our newsletter and stay updated on the latest developments and special offers!

ODM now says it has prioritised consensus in selecting candidates for various seats. Again, only time will tell whether or not this will help women politicians.

The party’s National Elections Board chairperson Catherine Muma notes consensus was at the core of ODM’s nomination process, as it was provided for in the outfit’s rules.

“In our new rules, we try to reach consensus and find the right candidate to fly our party’s ticket,” says Muma, adding, “In the past, most nomination slots in Nyanza were won by men. However, we hope things will change in future.”

But those who have dominated the region’s politics may not be resting easy ahead of the 2022 General Election as more women seek to take the battle for seats a notch higher.

They are seeking to relive the days of Grace Onyango, the first woman to be elected MP in Kenya, former assistant minister Grace Ogot and former Karachuonyo MP Phoebe Asiyo.

And the aggressiveness with which the women are preparing for the elections, marshalling support at the grassroots, may be an indication that things are likely to change in Nyanza’s leadership.

Already, two women leaders have thrown their hats into the ring as they seek to replace two retiring governors. Homa Bay Woman Rep Gladys Wanga hopes to succeed Governor Cyprian Awiti as her Migori counterpart Pamela Odhiambo also hopes to take over the reins in her region as incumbent Governor Okoth Obado concludes his second and final term.

However, Wanga and Odhiambo are facing a stiff challenge from veteran male politicians who are also eyeing the seats. In Homa Bay, for instance, Wanga will be facing off with, among others, former Nairobi governor Evans Kidero, ODM chairman John Mbadi and current deputy governor Hamilton Orata.

Former Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga, who recently rejoined the party, has also expressed interest in the county’s top seat.

But Wanga is unfazed, maintaining she was better placed to take over the seat and make history as the next governor in the region.

Dominated for years

“We have gained enough experience to take over seats that have been dominated by men for years,” Wanga said.

Wanga will be using her experience as the chairperson of the powerful Finance and National Planning Committee of the National Assembly to sell her bid. She says her performance as a woman representative will give her a successful bid for the county’s top job.

Yesterday, Wanga told The Standard the difficulties women eyeing political seats face, including ridicule and propaganda.

“This has been so despite contributions women make to the society as well as to major political parties,” she said.

Wanga said: “Women have always been at the forefront championing various issues. We are confident many more women will be elected in next year’s elections.”

Wanga said she has already been a victim of propaganda and violence since she expressed her interest to contest the governor’s seat.

However, there seems to be a shift with more people beginning to endorse female candidates.

Both Wanga and Odhiambo have been endorsed by elders to contest the seats. They have also received a green light from ODM to build their grassroots support ahead of 2022.

About a month ago, the Luo Council of Elders in Rangwe Sub-county endorsed Wanga for the governor’s seat. The elders said their support for Wanga was based on her development plans.

In a past interview, Odhiambo urged women leaders on, saying: “We must develop inner strength and confidence to speak for ourselves as we await 2022. We will win.”

And the future looks bright for women politicians if what happened in the recent elections is anything to go by. In Homa Bay, three women competed with men and won in 2017. Millie Odhiambo (Suba North), Lilian Gogo (Rangwe) and Eve Obara (Kabondo Kasipul), who was elected on ODM tickets, are already working on their re-election bids.

The three MPs have been meeting opinion leaders and elders to build grassroots support. They are also banking their hopes on the development projects they have initiated to earn a second term.

In 2017, only 12 women were elected to county assembly seats out of a total of 145 wards in the four Luo Nyanza counties. No woman won any of the top county seats of governor and senator.

Women had also been using “Embrace”, a political initiative that brought together women leaders, to market themselves. Some of the region’s women politicians who played key roles in “Embrace” were woman representatives Rosa Buyu (Kisumu), Christine Ombaka (Siaya), Janet Ongera (Kisii) and Migori’s Odhiambo. A host of women MPs and MCAs also took part.

Clinching top seats

According to veteran politician and the only female MCA in the region, Prisca Misachi, women are capable of clinching top seats.

“Let us not look at it as if these seats are reserved for men. Women too are capable of leading,” said Misachi, the only MCA who survived in Kisumu in the 2017 elections.

And according to Wanga, efforts by women have also been curtailed by lack of finances. “Resource mobilisation is a major challenge, but we are doing our best,” she said.

Citizen Conventions Party leader Grace Akumu shared Wanga’s sentiments, saying the general unequal distribution of resources has affected campaigns by women.

“Women have not had it easy. That is why I started a party to prove women too can achieve something,” according to Akumu, who is Deputy President William Ruto's supporter.",Politics,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

An advisory by the Office of the Attorney General approving the appointment of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) Communications Manager Tabitha Mutemi (pictured) as a board member of the Media Council of Kenya (MCK) has emerged.

The document conflicts with another issued by the same office disqualifying Mutemi from holding the position while still serving as an employee of the electoral commission.

This comes on the backdrop of a petition to the National Assembly to have her fired from the board for gross misconduct, and in breach of the Constitution for holding two public offices.

According to IEBC Act, members and employees of the commission are prohibited from holding other public offices during their tenure.

In the May 9, 2019 advisory to ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru, AG Paul Kihara said: “The State Corporations Act does not prohibit the appointment of public officers serving at any level of government as members of boards of a State corporation.”

The advisory by the AG had been issued in September 2020 upon a request by the ICT ministry.

The differences between Mutemi and MCK have been brewing for months and it was not until in January that there appeared to be a fallout.

On January 11, MCK Chief Executive David Omwoyo informed the board that they would no longer pick tabs for expenses incurred by Mutemi, citing an advisory by the AG that she cannot be an IEBC staffer and an MCK board member. MCK and Kihara have been silent on the advisory issued in May 2019 by the AG during the recruitment of the council board members. The advisory was at the request of a committee that was to undertake the recruitment.

Eric Oduor, the chair of the now-defunct selection panel, admitted that they relied on advice by the AG.

In a letter to the National Assembly Speaker dated March 29, Oduor noted that the AG was specific that MCK was not a State corporation and hence the IEBC law did not bar Mutemi from holding a board seat.

“In the advisory dated May 9, 2019, the Attorney General advised that the only bar to a person being appointed to the board of a State corporation was where the individual was a State officer or a board member of other State corporations within the national government,” said Oduor.

Despite the existence of the earlier advisory, the AG’s office has stuck to its later advice that Mutemi cannot be a board member of MCK and an employee of IEBC.

Recently, Solicitor General Kennedy Ogeto denied knowledge of the advisory when he appeared before the National Assembly Committee on Communication, Information and Innovation over Mutemi’s ouster from the board.

Instead, Ogeto only referred to another conflicting advisory that stated that her continued stay in office was in contravention of the law and IEBC Act.

In Parliament, a petitioner, Muriuki Muriungi, argues that Mutemi’s holding of the two offices was in contravention of the Constitution.",Politics,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

Migori Governor Zachary Obado has signaled plans to decamp ODM and vie for president in 2022.

Mr Obado, who was elected on ODM in 2017, has had a frosty relationship with the party, and its leader Raila Odinga.

He now says he will form a party or revamp People's Democratic Party, which he used to vie in 2013. He said he would vie for presidency and urged Migori residents to back him.

Without mentioning names, Obado said ""someone cheated"" Raila, later changed tack and formed a new political outfit - One Kenya Alliance.

The party brings together ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi, Wiper's Kalonzo Musyoka, Ford-Kenya's Moses Wetang'ula and Kanu chair Gideon Moi.

Political analysts believe the new outfit is backed by President Uhuru Kenyatta. Obado claimed without Raila in the new political formation, the Luo community would be sidelined.

The Musalia Mudavadi-led party had expelled Osotsi over misconduct and failing to toe party ideologies.

ANC wrote to the Registrar of Political Parties Anne Nderitu to deregister the lawmaker, which was effected on May 13, 2019.

“This office acknowledges receipt of your letter dated May 13, 2019, on the above subject matter, together with the judgements delivered in the High Court at Nairobi on Civil Appeal No 177 of 2018 and Judicial Review matter No 97 of 2019,” the letter from Nderitu to ANC and copied to Osotsi reads in part.

The 84 -kilometer dualing project will cost Sh33 billion. [Photo:Jacinta Mutura,Standard)

President Uhuru Kenyatta is elaborately following the script of former president Mwai Kibaki of rolling out mega projects in his backyard heading into his last year at the helm.

Just like Uhuru, Kibaki dedicated his first years in the presidency for national causes and development, almost creating the impression that he was neglecting his backyard.

But the last stretch provides an ideal opportunity to chip back home and the Uhuru government is pumping billions of shillings in development projects in Mt Kenya just two years after Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria claimed the region was neglected during a 2019 New Year Party at Thika Stadium.

The president commissioned construction of the Sh30 billion Kenol-Makutano-Sagana-Karatina-Marua highway, 84km of the Great Northern Highway and Sh27 billion Mau Mau cluster network connecting Nyeri, Murang’a, Nyandarua and Kiambu counties, a stretch of 540km.

In Kiambu County, backyard roads under construction include 45km Mau Mau spur roads in Gatundu North and 30km in Gatundu South.

Solar system installed

Other road projects are Ndarugu River-Mangu (Bob Harris road), Gatukuyu-Mataara, Gatundu-Munyu-ini (Ituramiro), Thika-Magumu and secondary highway from Wamwangi-Ichaweri-Mangu, which is part of a major parallel highway stretching all the way from Kiambu town to Githunguri.

Gatundu North MP Anne Kibe called for construction of Gatukuyu-Makwa-Ngorongo road.

Gatundu Hospital, formerly a Level 4, has leap-frogged to Level Six and will now be run by the Kenyatta University Teaching and Referral Hospital (KUTRH) as a branch.

Gatundu overtook Thika Level 5 and the Kiambu Level 4 hospitals.

The referral hospital has already deployed seven specialised doctors and 11 nurses at the Gatundu facility.

KUTRH chair Olive Mugenda said the upgrade will include management and training as well as renovation and infrastructural works.

Gatundu Hospital has enviable infrastructure after a four storied complex was built by Chinese contractors in Uhuru’s first term.

Speaking in Gatundu during takeover of the facility, Mugenda said the partnership will enable residents to enjoy services of a national referral hospital.

“Takeover by the government allows us to divert the resources we should have used here to upgrade the Igegania Hospital to a Level 4 facility and we shall also set up more infrastructure at the Karatu Hospital,” Kiambu Governor James Nyoro said.

“Already bulk oxygen, laundry facility and solar system is being installed and will be ready for commissioning in the next few weeks,” he added.

Kiambu County Government officials said the public from the neigbouring counties of Murang’a, Nakuru, Narok, Machakos and Nyandarua may soon troop to Gatundu to seek specialised medical care.

The Kibaki government injected more than Sh30 billion in the final year to construct the Thika superhighway.

When Kibaki launched the super highway on November 9, 2012, he described it as a source of “national pride.” This was just five months to the end of his term in April 2013, and the road was indeed a perfect retirement gift. The road serves motorists from Central, Eastern and North Eastern Kenya.

Construction of a rural road network awed Othaya residents and the former president toured the project whenever he visited his backyard.

The road network covers Karima-Kiandu-Ruringu, Othaya-Gatuya-ini-Munyange, Othaya-Kihuri, Othaya-Kairuthi-Tambaya-Witima-Kagumo-Kwa Ngechu and Kagere-Ndunyu-Njigari.

Decongest hospital

Some projects were abandoned after Kibaki exited power, prompting Chinga MCA Kiruga Thuku to lead demonstrations to demand completion of Kariki-Gichiche-Mumbu-ini-Kagicha-Mairungi-Kaero road. The road is now under construction alongside Othaya-Kairuthi-Gitugi-Gachami.

Thuku said residents will demonstrate to demand construction of Kagicha-Kiguthu-Maironi-Karuthi-Githagara road.

Kibaki made several tours to his backyard in 2012, accompanied mostly by then Roads Permanent Secretary Michael Kamau, who later had a short stint as Cabinet Secretary in the Uhuru government.

“The last years under Kibaki were a development revolution for Othaya with the entire road network converted into all-weather terrain,” said Innocent Gitonga, a resident.

Othaya Hospital was also upgraded to Level Six and overtook the former Nyeri Provincial General Hospital, which remains Level 5, and Karatina Level 4 Hospital.

More than Sh1 billion has been pumped into the Othaya Level Six Hospital, which had benefited from about Sh700 million by the time Kibaki left office in 2013.

Notably, the government pumped resources into the facility in the former president’s final term and high powered delegations visiting the facility became the norm led by then Health Minister Anyang’ Nyong’o, PS Mary Ngari and the parliamentary Public Accounts Committee chaired by Ikolomani MP Bonnie Khalwale.

Othaya Hospital Annex has since benefited from equipment and it was taken over by Kenyatta National Hospital from November 2019 and renamed the Kenyatta Hospital Annex.

KNH Chief Executive Officer Evanson Kamuri said during the takeover the hospital would serve eight counties in the region

It also has an Intensive Care Unit, specialised paediatric ward and a private wing.

“We are hoping to use this facility to not only bring KNH services closer to the people of this region, but also decongest the national referral hospital in Nairobi,” Kamuri said.

The level six hospital will be a referral centre for health facilities in Mt Kenya and Eastern.

It is now much different from the facility that had originally been allocated Sh501 million before the contractor reported having under quoted the project, forcing the Treasury to allocate Sh170 million more. At least Sh300 million in equipment went to the facility.

Commissioning of the Othaya hospital by Uhuru has been put off several times, with the latest being in March 2020, following the outbreak of Covid-19 in the country.",Politics,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

President Uhuru Kenyatta March 30, 2021, signed into law the Employment (Amendment) Bill of 2019 and Business Laws (Amendment) Bill of 2021. But what do these laws entail?

Employment (Amendment) Bill, 2019

The new Employment (Amendment) Bill provides that parents, who are in the process of adopting children, will now be eligible for one month of leave from work. In this case, an adoptive parent shall be required to notify his or her employer of the intention to have a child placed under their custody, and such notification shall be accompanied by the relevant adoption documents. This notification is supposed to be made at least 14 days before the child is placed under the custody of the adoptive parent.

“The pre-adoptive leave granted to an adoptive parent shall guarantee such adoptive parents an uninterrupted opportunity to make all the necessary arrangements that may be required before the adoptive parent takes full custody and responsibility for the adopted child”, the law states.

The Bill was first passed by the National Assembly on September 17, 2020, and presented to President Uhuru, who referred the Bill back to Parliament for reconsideration.

Read More

In his Memorandum, the president noted that the Bill contained provisions relating to surrogacy which is at present not regulated in Kenya.

Assenting to the Bill, as it was then, would therefore mean that the surrogacy agreements provided in the Bill would operate in a legislative vacuum, due to the absence of a substantive legal and regulatory framework to govern surrogacy in the country.

It is for this reason that the National Assembly reconsidered the Bill and amended the Bill in light of the President’s reservations.

Before the amendment, a married female employee was entitled to a fully paid pre-adoption leave of three consecutive months from the date of the placement of the child. A married male employee, on the other hand, was entitled to a fully paid pre-adoption leave for two weeks. This means that the period of leave for prospective adoptive parents has been shortened, and will therefore not be provided with an opportunity to bond with and understand their new child, compared to their counterparts who are accorded three months leave.

Business Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2021

The Business Laws (Amendment) Bill of 2021, which was introduced by National Assembly Majority Leader Amos Kimunya, gives companies and businesses the right to request information from an insolvency practitioner in respect of a company that has been placed under administration.

The insolvency practitioner is obliged to provide the information requested within five days or such other number of days agreed between the insolvency practitioner and the creditor.

The amendments further seek to clarify that an administrator can distribute routine payment to unsecured creditors without the court's permission. It also seeks to introduce a pre-insolvency moratorium period of 30 days to prevent creditors from taking an enforcement action while a company considers its option for rescue. Before the amendment, companies with large outstanding liabilities were ineligible to obtain a moratorium.

It is also no longer necessary for a Kenyan incorporated company to have a ‘common seal’ or attach seals to documentation. A company seal is a stamp used to validate official documents, like contracts, certificates, deeds, etc. Company seals contain the name and registration number of the company. The new law eliminates the requirement of affixing a company seal in the execution of company documents, contracts, and deeds.

A document, contract, or deed will instead be considered to be validly executed by a company if it is signed on behalf of the company by two authorized signatories or by a director of the company in the presence of a witness, who attests the signature.

This is intended to do away with the expensive and cumbersome process of having a sealing device and red wafers on documents that have to be embossed and then witnessed by two directors or one director and the company secretary. It also reflects the increasing use of technology to enable the execution of documents.

These changes are in line with global practices; they seek to ease doing business in Kenya. In addition, the new law will now facilitate businesses to hold hybrid and virtual meetings and support business operations as a result of the challenges experienced during the Covid-19 pandemic, saving businesses costs that would have been incurred in holding physical meetings.",Business,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

There will be several factors at play as more than 52,000 voters get to the ballot on May 18 to elect their next MP. Key among them include; the clan matrix, age factor, political affiliations, the political paradigm shift in the region and gender.

Already the national political realignments are playing out in the constituency. Supporters and leaders from the region who are aligned to Amani National Congress, Ford Kenya, KANU and Wiper party will support the Jubilee candidate. The parties' top leadership last week declared to support Opore in the polls.

There are also major realignments in the Gusii community; Those aligned to President Uhuru Kenyatta alongside Interior Cabinet Secretary Dr Fred Matiang'i, those supporting Deputy President William Ruto and those who have remained loyal to Raila Odinga.

On gender, Bititu and Otara will be seeking to break barriers in the deep-rooted patriarchal society. Should any of the two clinch the seat, she will become the first woman to be elected MP from the Gusii community.

Voters in the past have largely voted for their leaders based on the clan matrix. There are four major clans in the area; Bomorenda, Bogiakumu, Riana and Bomariba.

Oimeke, Opore, Ondieki and Mogaka represent the large Riana clan.The two women contenders are from Bomorenda clan while Oigo, Mosomi and Ogego are from Bogiakumu clan.

Oimeke could be winning big on party affiliations owing to the strong ODM political base in the region. The party leader, Raila, has had overwhelming support from locals for the past three elections.

Members of Parliament have faulted top Interior ministry officials for their failure to attend parliamentary committee sittings whenever they are summoned.

A tweet by Interior Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho expressing his disappointment over last Wednesday's failed meeting between ministry officials and a parliamentary committee appeared to have sparked the fury of the MPs.

“A little bit discouraged that our meeting today by the Parliamentary Committee on Administration and National Security was aborted due to lack of quorum, but we are more than ready to respond to the honourable members' questions and concerns as soon as they invite us again,” read Kibicho’s tweet on Wednesday.

In an attached video clip, Kibicho states that officials in the ministry, led by Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i, had congregated at their Harambee House office to honour an invite to the said virtual meeting committee.

He explained that the reason for the aborted meeting was a quorum hitch on the part of the lawmakers.

But members of the security committee would, the following day, state that they had boycotted the meeting to get back at the ministry officials whom they claimed had snubbed previous sittings.

It all started when two MPs, Kibwezi East's Jessica Mbalu and her Moyale counterpart Wario Qalicha, complained that statements they had sought from the Interior Ministry, through the security committee, had yielded unsatisfactory responses.

In answering concerns from the two lawmakers, members of the committee narrated instances that the Ministry of Interior and Coordination had allegedly slighted them, claiming they gave them no responses to questions their colleagues had raised on the floor of the House.

“What reason do we have to have a meeting with such people... We have been meeting for the last three-and-a-half years and I can say without any fear of contradiction that we have met the CS less than three times,” said Kitui Central MP Makali Mulu, claims that were backed by a host of his fellow committee members.

He added: “The only time the PS comes with a full team is when we are discussing the budget. When we are discussing matters as important as questions from MPs, they are never there.”

Kisumu Woman Representative Rosa Buyu said: “Many times, the committee has had to call off its meetings with the ministry officials at the very last minute and no reason has been given.”

While many underlying issues were raised by the MPs, including claims that their resolutions were numerously voided, the dominant concern was that Matiang’i and Kibicho had been skipping their sessions. The MPs, however, did not give details of instances where Matiang'i and his team had snubbed them.

National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi, who also faulted the Interior ministry officials over their responses, directed Majority Leader Amos Kimunya and Majority Whip Emmanuel Wangwe to convene a meeting between the committee and the Ministry of Interior to discuss its future engagements with Parliament.

However, the Thursday afternoon outburst was not the first time the Interior CS and his PS were the subjects of accusation that they are ignoring parliamentary sittings.

Last August, Matiang’i appeared before Senate’s security committee over the arrest of three senators. This was on the eve of a day they were to vote on the third basis revenue-sharing formula, whose debate had been divisive.

The session – which the media was barred from – came hot on the heels of another one that the Interior CS failed to attend. The committee’s chair at the time, the late Yussuf Haji, reported to the House that Matiang’i failed to show up courtesy of a break the President had directed members of his Cabinet to take.

Months earlier, Matiang'i had clashed with the Senate ad-hoc committee on Covid-19. The committee’s then-chairman Johnson Sakaja issued summons to the CS after he had skipped its sittings four times.

Matiang’i had been invited to answer questions on alleged police brutality in enforcing a curfew that had been put in place as a containment measure against the spread of Covid-19.

In February 2019, the CS angered senators in the security committee after failing to appear to issue a status report on the government’s Huduma Namba project.

The script was similar in June 2018 when the CS skipped a meeting with a joint parliamentary committee investigating contraband sugar importation.

In a letter, PS Kibicho would later state that Matiang’i had been engaged in that year’s East African Heads of State summit and requested a fresh date for the meeting, which he attended.

Muturi's sanctioned meeting, if it materialises, will not be the first attempt to iron out apparent differences between Parliament and the Matiang’i-led ministry.

President Uhuru Kenyatta is facing a major political dilemma in replacing the six ousted nominated senators, as some of their potential replacements are allies of Deputy President William Ruto.

United Democratic Alliance (UDA) Secretary General Veronica Maina is among the top names in a closed party list filed with the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), making her an automatic pick should the six lose their seats.

Nominated Senators Isaac Mwaura, Millicent Omanga, Mary Seneta, Falhada Dekow, Naomi Waqo and Victor Prengei have been expelled for associating with Dr Ruto.

It would be interesting to see how Jubilee wiggles around the dilemma since ending up with another set of allies of Ruto will not achieve the intended purpose of the purge.

The other potential replacements may also kick up a storm over regional balance, as the two top nominees are from Murang’a County, while another is from Nakuru. Most of the expelled senators were either from the marginalised or minority communities. For instance, Mr Prengei is from the minority Ogiek community, while Ms Waqo, Ms Falhada and Ms Senata are from the Borana, Somali and Maasai communities. Mr Mwaura is Kikuyu while Ms Omanga is Kisii.

Article 98 of the Constitution requires political parties to nominate 16 women, according to the proportion of members of the Senate elected, and two other nominees being one man and one woman, representing the youth, one man and one woman representing persons with disabilities.

The lists apply according to the priority set out by political parties, implying that the higher a candidate is on the lists of their respective political parties, the higher their chances of being nominated.

Therefore, should the party effect the ouster, the six will be replaced by Caroline Daudi (Machakos), Veronica Maina (Murang’a), Francisca Kamuren (Nakuru) and Beatrice Gambo (Coast).

Mwaura, who was picked to represent persons with disability, would be replaced by Joyce Amasong, who is listed under the same category while Prengei, who represents the youth, will be replaced by Peris Wambui from Murang’a County.

It has emerged that the potential dilemma in replacing the senators was the main reason in the delay, by National Executive Council (NEC), to implement removal of the five senators even after a report by the Disciplinary Committee recommended their ouster.

The committee made recommendations against the five mid-last year and only revived the process after Mwaura was drugged through a similar process in February.

However, Jubilee Secretary General Raphael Tuju said there was no dilemma. He said the party will review the membership status of the nominees before they are considered for nomination.

Tuju ruled out the nomination of Veronica saying she is no longer a member of Jubilee after she was picked as an official of UDA.

“She is the Secretary-General of UDA. That means she cannot be nominated by Jubilee to the Senate. Again, some of the people on the list to the IEBC stopped paying their membership fees. We will have to review the status of each nominee before settling on individuals to nominate,” said Tuju.

On Friday, the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal declined to issue conservatory orders barring the Registrar of Political Parties from removing Mwaura’s name from the membership of Jubilee Party.

The tribunal’s dismissal of the case now puts the senators at the mercy of President Uhuru Kenyatta as party leader on whether they will keep their jobs.

Registrar of Political Parties Ann Nderitu said the decision to complete the removal process now lies with the party.

“The ball is in the court of JP to write to the office of the registrar interpreting the ruling and the instructions to delete them from the party’s list,” said Nderitu.

Yesterday Tuju also confirmed writing to the registrar to immediately effect the changes against the six nominated senators.

“We have officially written to the registrar of parties to have the names removed from the Jubilee membership roll,” he said.

But Soy MP Caleb Kositany said they would battle the ouster of the lawmakers to the Supreme Court and expressed confidence the troubled senators would serve their full term.

He said in the event they are removed; the party would have to pick from the list that is already with the electoral commission.

“There’s no way they can nominate from outside the list that is with the IEBC. But even before we get there, we are going to exploit all the appeal mechanism provided for in the law,” said Mr Kositany.

He added: “I can tell you the senators will serve their term to the end. They have done no wrong. It is just victimisation.”

The six found themselves in bad books with Jubilee after it accused them of being disloyal.

Of all his belongings, the hat appears his most prized. He wears it on every occasion. Besides the hat, his towering height and symmetrical frame–seemingly made for suits–make him hard to miss in an event or media briefing. Then there is his impeccable jawline.

You would notice these physical attributes if the Mheshimiwa for Kimilili walks into a room. And in case you miss his entrance, you would notice him from his thick accent and the forceful manner through which he speaks, which make him the most conspicuous person in any crowd.

When he speaks, his jawline doesn’t seem as impressive, distorting, courtesy of his aggressive speaking. And Didi knows that speaking as he does, he has a thing going for him.

For the longest time, Raila Odinga has had his name played from the speaker that is Didi’s mouth. The Kimilili lawmaker has composed songs castigating Baba and vowed to do all within his power to block his ascension to the presidency.

Back to his hat. From his love for the accessory, it wouldn’t be surprising to learn that he may take showers with it. That he keeps it at his bedside may be another revelation that wouldn’t surprise anyone.

Curiously, whenever he has removed the hat, it was always as a result of some coercion occasioned by his presence in rather sacred grounds.

In Bunge, his fellow MPs are always ready to flag the presence of the ‘unparliamentary’ attire to the Speaker. His colleagues are, however, humane as they accord him the chance to remove his headgear by himself.

Others haven’t been as kind. In 2019, the co-opted body part was spotted in Kibra, the sacred place referred to as Baba’s bedroom.

Didi, alongside other Jubilee party members, thought they could sneak in the party’s candidate in the constituency’s by-election, McDonald Mariga, inside Baba’s sleeping place in his absence.

As the Kimilili MP found out when he was roughed up by some goons, Baba is the only one allowed to wear a hat in his bedroom. Of all the things the goons could have obtained from him, they chose his most valuable possession.

Later, during an Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party rally, the cap found itself on the unfamiliar head of Suna East MP Junet Mohamed, who confessed to having found it too precious to give back to the owner. That was after Didi had issued threats to whoever had stolen the hat to give it back.

But that is not the only hat Didi is known to wear. Elected into Bunge in 2017, the first-time lawmaker was among a handful of MPs who won as independent candidates.

He would soon learn that there was no fun in being independent and joined Jubilee before later settling into the splinter Tangatanga faction, where, just like his cap, he fit perfectly.

Until recently, he had been a vocal defender of the deputy president, telling off his opponents on various platforms. Last week, Didi announced that he would be taking a break from actively supporting the William Ruto-led faction. His reason? The unity of his community was more important than everything he had said for years now when he did the DP's bidding.

His move came on the heels of humiliating defeats of United Democratic Alliance party candidates in two by-elections in the western region.

And while Didi insists that his road to Damascus moment is as a result of fashioning unity, the defeats in Matungu and Kabuchai suggest that he had no choice but to align himself with what the ground was saying.

Just as he has been forced to take off his headgear in Bunge and Kibra, circumstances are seemingly forcing him to assess his allegiances and seek another strategy that would better fit his need for political survival.",Politics,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

If ODM leader Raila Odinga chooses to, he could bolt out of what is left of the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) process. But that would only make him look bad, for he has been telling Kenyans nobody can stop the BBI reggae.

He must, therefore, sulkily hang in there, even as he ponders on the next steps towards the reggae of the 2022 election and whether it can be won and with which partnership. Already, he was set up to denounce his National Super Alliance (Nasa) allies.

They strategically asked him to return the “repeated political favours” they had done him by stepping down for him to have the opposition presidential ticket over the years. His response was cryptic. “They were cowards who had abandoned him during his extra-legal swearing in of 30 January 2018.”

It was an act of desolate hope and desperation for them to dream of his support.

ODM Secretary General Edwin Sifuna keeps rubbing it in. They are cowards and liabilities, he says. The moment of truth is here at last, however, when the ripe and unripe must be separated. The Deputy President’s voice in the BBI has been neutered. Raila has been cornered. BBI will sail through. Then focus will be on 2022, with President Uhuru Kenyatta in the mix. At this point, it is difficult to tell which of the five pieces in the Executive, Uhuru has his eye on – and whether it is for himself, or his alternate.

Regardless, the interest is certainly there. You don’t remove power from other constitutional offices to heap it in one office in the Executive only to hand that office over to someone else.

Raila and Ruto are left staring at each other in a strange corner, where they will be asking, “How did we get here, and what are you doing here?” They will be pondering their options in that corner. ODM’s reluctance to field candidates in recent by-elections speaks of a party in recession and a party leader whose tyres are losing their grip, with the tube in multiple slow punctures.

Raila could brave it out and try to assemble another pentagon to go against the One Kenyan Alliance and the DP in a three horse race. It would promise a tough and messy affair that could force a presidential election run off. Accordingly, all players must moderate what they say about one another at this stage. They might need each other’s support to cross over to the Promised Land in September/October 2022.

Ruto faces the Hobson’s Choice. He could go with Raila, if ODM boss chooses to support him, at the risk of losing the Mt Kenya following, on account of the former PM support. Or, he could go it alone. Like the great Napoleon Bonaparte, he would soon discover you need partners in any battle, even when you are a great general. But would he also consider eating humble pie and working with the One Kenya Alliance? Would this be a stretching of political humility beyond its elasticity?

This is where President Kenyatta has brought two gentlemen who thought he was their friend. The way ahead is to be watched, including to see what plans Uhuru seems to have for himself, or his family, in the emerging scenario. When Raila has recovered from his current challenges with Covid-19 and rediscovers his tongue, what words are going to roll on the tongue? And words don’t roll on a dry tongue. What smoothie is he going to whet his tongue with? Will it be a smoothie blended with waters of humility in the wings of the One Kenya Alliance, or will it be a smoothie that helps the tongue to belt out defiant reggae tunes? Conversely, will the alliance survive bitter internal competitions for dominance and supremacy?

If the alliance should easily settle for one of them as the presidential flagbearer, are they thinking of how to mollify ethnic populations that are looking up to each one of them as the gallant tribal leader who bring home the golden fleece?

President Uhuru Kenyatta’s days as a power-sharing Head of State are over.

In recent months, the president has been reconstructing political control and influence around himself. What remains are the finishing touches, through the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI).

Instead of being a lame duck president in the sunset of his second term, Uhuru is getting everyone in politics and public administration to be answerable to him. This is regardless of political party affiliation, or position in politics.

A successful BBI is expected to crown the remaking of political power since the nusu mkate government days of President Mwai Kibaki and Prime Minister Raila Odinga.

The BBI is expected to firm up the necessary elements of law, even as the president continues to manage the politics.

The first five years of his tenure created the impression that Uhuru was in a co-presidency with his deputy, William Ruto, in the Jubilee Alliance of TNA and URP.

The legal adversity facing them in the days of the International Criminal Court (ICC) tied them up in the Gordian Knot of self-preservation.

They carried this into an awkward first term. They appointed the Cabinet together, turned out in public in matching attire and addressed public functions like partners.

Enter the handshake

Then came the Handshake of March 2018, following the troubled presidential election the previous year. Ruto was traded in for Odinga.

In exchange, Uhuru got the recognition and legitimacy that Raila had denied him after the 2017 election. Raila has since comported himself in public like a co-star in the presidency.

Cabinet Secretaries have briefed him at his private offices on undisclosed matters. He behaves at functions as Uhuru’s alter ego, with the two bowing to each other as political brothers.

The notion of shared power is, however, slowly but surely perishing. Uhuru is breathing life into his words late last year that he is in charge and in control.

But, beyond consolidation of power, what could President Kenyatta be up to? What does he intend to do with consolidated political power?

At the burial of Hannah Atsianzale, the mother to ANC party leader, Musalia Mudavadi, late last year, a visibly irate Uhuru told the country that he was fully in the driver’s seat. He had sat patiently, the whole day, listening to a series of slapdash political lectures and sundry bosh, some directed at him.

COTU Secretary General, Francis Atwoli, melodramatically asked the president to crack the whip on politicians whom he accused of not toeing the line. He offered to help if the head of State was not equal to the task. Kakamega Senator, Cleophas Malala, raised the curtain to Atwoli’s counsel to the president.

An irate Uhuru singled the two out in his terse reply to critics. He cut to the chase. “When you see a lion that has been rained on, do not mistake it for a cat,” he said, “I am fully in control and in charge in this country.”

Recent happenings leave no doubt that the president is calling everyone’s bluff. He is seen less in public. But when he appears, it is with some memorable message, by word or in deed. Recent optics of him and coastal governors, Ali Hassan Joho of Mombasa, Kilifi’s Amason Kingi and – separately – Salim Mvurya of Kwale, sent tongues wagging.

Unverified reports suggested that he was disturbed that the coastal leaders were forming a regional political party. This would be contrary to the letter and spirit of the 2010 Constitution and the Political Parties Act (2011) and its amendments of 2017. President Uhuru Kenyatta during a joint Press release by various Political Party Leaders at State House, Nairobi. Present at the presser are party leaders; Gideon Moi (KANU), Musalia Mudavadi (ANC), Kalonzo Musyoka (WIPER), Raila Odinga (ODM), Charity Ngilu (NARC) and Mosses Wetangula (FORD Kenya).

One Kenya Alliance

Yet, if anyone should attempt to form a party outside the legal framework, there would be no need for the president to intervene, as has been claimed.

That is the remit of the Registrar of Political Parties, who is on record for rejecting numerous non-compliant applications to register political parties. Hence, we must look elsewhere for answers to what is going on at State House.

The most obvious happening is the consolidation of political power. Apart from the meetings with the coastal leaders, there have been other telling happenings. The emergence of the One Kenya Alliance symbolises the return of Kanu, with President Kenyatta in the lead with Baringo Senator Gideon Moi of Kanu, as a close aide.

Put together with Wiper’s Kalonzo Musyoka, ANC’s Mudavadi and Senator Wetang’ula’s Ford Kenya, the alliance is a jaw dropper. It begins placing the centre of power where President Moi wanted it in 2002.

With the exception of Deputy President Ruto, who is ploughing his own furrow, does the new generation of would-have-been Kanu leaders in 2002 seem to have groped in the political dark and eventually found a common place to start from afresh?

Does the new formation seem to be blurring Raila, and elbowing him out from the centre? Did Uhuru place Raila on a slow puncture with the Handshake? Has Odinga lost his script or, his lines in the unfolding political drama?

And what does the president want to do with a renascent Kanu in the guise of One Kenya Alliance? Can Raila and Ruto survive the intrigues that seem to inform the alliance’s bag of tricks?

When the Handshake and the BBI came to occupy the centre stage of politics, it seemed rather obvious that the president and his perennial arch rival had closed ranks, at last.

It seemed that the former Prime Minister was the person President Kenyatta now had his sights on as his successor.

The challenge remained how to successfully market and sell him in the Mt Kenya region. For, with the exception of the short-lived goodwill from the “Kibaki Tosha” declaration of 2002, the region has been allergic to the Odinga name.

Jaundiced propaganda was initially aimed at his father, Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, in the 1960s. He was cast as a person “who wanted to take away power” from the elder Kenyatta and to emasculate the Kikuyu people.

The Odinga name remains the local political bugaboo. If you want anything done, you simply tell the people to be swift, lest Raila should ascend to power.

For a moment, therefore, it has seemed that undoing this historical jinx was Uhuru’s biggest challenge in the region, ahead of his retirement.

Besides, the challenge has seemed to snowball in the wake of what has looked like Ruto’s hold on the Mountain. These incursions have, moreover, been bed-rocked on Uhuru’s own declarative promise of support for Ruto in 2022, with the mantra of “Ten years for me, and ten for Ruto.”

The One Kenya Alliance is the new Pentagon in town. The only disguised part of the five-piece pie chart is Uhuru himself. Played around the proposed BBI Executive of five, however, you do not need to seek too hard for the missing piece. T

he dynamics of the alliance around the Jubilee Party in by-elections, and the BBI, speak of a team that is determined to keep power. The converse is locking out both the deputy president and the ODM leader.

If the deputy president saw the scheme in good time, the former Prime Minister appears to have misread the signs.

Murathe’s prophecy

In December 2019, Jubilee Party’s deputy chair, David Murathe, was alluding to the possibility that the party would deny the DP its presidential ticket.

At that year’s Vihiga Cultural Festival, Murathe left little room for doubt on who he had in mind in his exclusionary remarks about the foremost Jubilee ticket for 2022.

Earlier, in 2017, he had intimated on national television that Uhuru’s second term would see a transformed, bolder and more ruthless Head of State.

Every step of Uhuru’s growth in boldness and ruthlessness assertiveness has gone hand in glove with Murathe’s hostile engagement against the DP.

There have been postures to expel him from the Jubilee Party, to pass a motion of No Confidence in him in Parliament and impeach him, as well as threats to forcefully evict him from the Deputy Presidential residence in Karen.

While seeming to take it coolly, without ceasing to confess his loyalty to the president and their friendship, the DP has nonetheless been busy, cultivating his own political terrain across the country. This has, in turn, won him political friends and enemies alike. Two of his foremost critics have been the president and the former PM.

But, the One Kenya Alliance leaders have not spared him either. They have all too often made declamatory public protests against what they call his mysterious wealth, with the clear object of diminishing his political standing as a decent person and credible leader.

In turn, he has called them representatives of provincial interests, out to gang up against him and the people. Meanwhile, he has roved across the country, with populist gifts to the downtrodden, to youth groups, and to the religious fraternity.

This has made the competition fidgety. They are now set to try to run him out of town, with a revanchist Kanu in a new guise. No need to guess who is the second in command after Uhuru.

Raila, on the other hand, rested too much on borrowed glory. Uhuru made him the proverbial frog that is placed in a container with cold water. Heat is progressively introduced and intensified at the bottom of the container.

By the time the rest of the frog family realises what is happening to one of its own, the water has risen to boiling point, with the poor frog still in place.

It is this waking up that was at work at a funeral in Nyanza two weeks ago, when an angry Senator James Orengo warned public servants whom he said were scheming to frustrate Raila and the BBI.

Rarieda MP, Otiende Amollo, promised “to take Kenya back to where it was in January 2018, if any one attempts to frustrate Odinga.” He promised, “in the name of God,” that things would never be the same again.

It is all about power and power games.

The Handshake gave Uhuru the legitimacy he so badly needed, following the NASA boycott of the repeat presidential election of October 2017. It also threw over the country and the government a blanket of tranquility.

Apart from isolated and far between whimpers from people whom he often summons to State House for a cup of tea and têt-à-têt, President Kenyatta has had a peaceful second term.

His only frustration seems to have sprung from the Tangatanga corner of his Jubilee Party, with intermittent booms of rebellion from his Mt Kenya base.

His success with the One Kenya Alliance hinges, very much, on whether he could tame his own backyard and convince it to vote for one of the four kingpins.

For Raila, the game would appear to be moving towards end time. He recognised Uhuru and worked with him to deliver a BBI Bill that seems all set to become law.

The president does not have much further need for him, hence the developments that Orengo and Otiende are worried about.

Uhuru has closed down the BBI Secretariat and taken the activities to his own office, under Interior Principal Secretary, Dr Karanja Kibicho.

This places control of both the BBI funds and process in his bind. Odinga and his team are now partners in the fringes of the effort.

The real people who count are the One Kenya Alliance members.

How the 70 new constituencies proposal in the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) will be handled appears to be a key determinant on how Mt Kenya region may vote in the impending referendum.

There have been proposals from some quarters to reopen this debate. During public participation on the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill 2020, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) said it wanted the delimitation of boundaries mandate left to it.

Legislators from Mt Kenya region fear that a move to have Parliament or the two legal committees from the Senate and the National Assembly amend the Bill, especially on this clause, may deny Mt Kenya region the 15 additional constituencies.

There is an argument that the region will also indirectly benefit from 18 other constituencies earmarked for Nairobi, Nakuru and Laikipia.

The joint committee co-chairmen Muturi Kigano and Okong’o Omogeni did not table the report in the House but instead requested for more days after identifying six areas they said required the help of experts before the report is tabled.

The areas identified are the nature of the Bill, public participation and its extent, the way of processing the Bill, substantive issue of the Bill, the referendum and status of litigation touching on the Bill. The move by the committee has raised questions on the constitutionality and participatory role of Senate and National Assembly in the constitution-making process.

With the IEBC having termed as unconstitutional the proposal in the BBI to allocate 70 additional constituencies to some 28 counties, many Mt Kenya legislators are worried that “some monkey business” is being planned.

Among those who have raised concerns are MPs Ngunjiri Wambugu (Nyeri Town), Sabina Chege (Murang’a), Wangari Mwaniki (Kigumo), Nduati Ngugi (Gatanga) and Kathuri Murungi (South Imenti).

Others are Rahim Dawood (North Imenti), Cate Waruguru (Laikipia) and Peter Kimari (Mathioya) who have maintained that Parliament has no power to amend the report agreed in a negotiated process.

While making the one man, one vote crusade a key plank of his message during the Sagana State Lodge consultations with Mt Kenya leaders in January, President Uhuru Kenyatta paraded dozens of MCAs from wards with more population than some constituencies elsewhere.

He said it was a glaring example of how densely populated areas were getting a raw deal in budgetary allocations and public recruitment.

Tinkering with boundaries

“We even have evidence of when they started tinkering with district boundaries in the 1980s that resulted in the unfair distribution of counties when the 1992 cut-off was used,” Uhuru told the meeting at Sagana.

At his meeting with MPs, he is said to have wished he was staying much longer to rectify the county distribution matter.

Dawood said no region should think that reopening the 70 constituencies debate will favour them against others.

“If we were to remove the protection of the 30 constituencies, counties like Isiolo and Lamu would remain with just one and extras would go to populated areas like Meru,” he said.

“It would also be a strong basis to push for splitting of larger counties like Meru and Kiambu since budgetary allocations to each county start at Sh2 billion.”

The legislators are citing the experience under the Interim Independent Boundaries Review Commission that was last to conduct a negotiated review of boundaries after the 2007 disputed General Election.

The Andrew Ligale team is blamed for allegedly giving Mt Kenya a raw deal and parallels have been drawn after IEBC Chairman Chebukati said that while BBI promoters are right to create the constituencies, they erred in allocating the constituencies to specific counties.

Ligale has always insisted the process was free and fair.

In parliament, Chebukati said distributing the constituencies to counties is the work of the commission as stipulated in Articles 84(4)(c) and 89 of the Constitution.

Anti-BBI crusaders have been accusing the drafters of the report of favouring President Kenyatta’s backyard, claiming that it was a ploy by the president to reward his region before retiring.

However, a section of elected leaders from Mt Kenya have vehemently opposed any move to open the discussion of amending the report and to be precise the discussion on creation of more constituencies.

And in an indication of how dear the region holds the issue, it has led to the closing ranks of the Kieleweke and Tanga Tanga political factions.

Wambugu said it will not be possible for Parliament to amend the report as that would be illegal and unconstitutional.

“Altering the BBI report by either the Senate or National Assembly is not possible. The Bill must be debated on as it is; and either passed or rejected as it is both at Parliament and in the referendum,” he said.

Kathuri of South Imenti said the reason why BBI was popular in areas like Imenti and Igembe was purely because it offers an opportunity to correct historical boundaries distribution injustices.

Kimari said a section of leaders from other regions have been opposed to the idea of Mt Kenya getting more constituencies. He however maintained that the region was not getting any favour but the additional constituencies was on merit since the census results dictated which county would receive how many constituencies.

“There has been a narrative that Mt Kenya would gain more with the report but its not about gaining, it is a move to rectify historical injustices,” he said.

Nduati said Mt Kenya region leaders would unite to oppose any move to amend BBI by Parliament, saying such a move would make the 47 County Assemblies wonder why they were never given the chance to do the same.

Chege said, “No chance should be given for reopening the BBI. We should pass what the counties passed given that a citizen may have appended her signature on the basis of a particular clause that if amended, she or he may wish to withdraw her support.”

Mwaniki said the report sought to address inequity in both representation and resource allocation and it was the main reason the region backed the report.

Laikipia Woman Rep Cate Waruguru said Kenyans have already proposed their wishes in the report and no one, including the IEBC or Parliament, can amend it.

“We expect nothing more or less from what was proposed by Kenyans, so if they have any amendments, they should be advised that it cannot be done now in the National Assembly or Senate,” said Waruguru.",Politics,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

The fate of six nominated senators expelled by Jubilee Party now lies with President Uhuru Kenyatta.

The senators had got a temporary reprieve over a month ago when the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal halted their removal from the party, a day after Jubilee Secretary General Raphael Tuju communicated the decision of the National Management Committee (NMC).

The move was at the time opposed by the Tangatanga wing of the party allied to Deputy President William Ruto, claiming it was a tactic to deny them numbers during the Senate Parliamentary Group meeting to kick out Murang’a Senator Irungu Kang’ata as Majority Whip.

On Friday, the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal declined to issue conservatory orders barring the Registrar of Political Parties from removing Nominated Senator Isaac Mwaura’s name from the membership of Jubilee Party.

The party expelled Mwaura and five other nominated senators in February over disciplinary issues. Other senators expelled were Mary Seneta, Falhada Iman, Naomi Wago, Victor Prengei, Millicent Omanga and Christine Gona.

Mwaura lodged a complaint at the tribunal on February 9, saying he was not furnished with the details of the charge against him.

The senator said he was only given a three days’ notice to prepare for hearing and he was not provided with the decision of the National Disciplinary Committee (NDC) before it was submitted to the NMC for ratification.

He said there was no evidence to support the allegations made against him that he was disloyal to the party or that he contravened the party position, among others.

Jubilee Party, in its reply, said all the party laws regarding disciplinary proceedings were complied with. The party held that it had sufficient evidence showing Mwaura praising the ideology of a different political party, being welcomed into a fray by the chairman of the said party and subsequently being donned with the outfit’s branded cap.

Gross violation

Jubilee Party submitted that the action by Mwaura was a gross violation of both the Political Parties Act and the party’s constitution.

The tribunal, in its ruling, said there was no demonstrated threat of conclusive implementation of Jubilee Party’s decision during the pendency of the proceedings before it.

In the ruling signed by Chairman Desma Nungo and members Milly Lwanga and Paul Ngotho, the tribunal dismissed Mwaura’s notice of motion. Instead of issuing the temporary orders, the tribunal ordered that the complaint be heard fully.

The tribunal’s dismissal of the case now puts the senators at the mercy of the president as party leader on whether they will keep their jobs or be sent packing.

Yesterday, the Registrar of Political Parties Ann Nderitu said the decision to complete the removal process now lies with the party.

“The ball is in the court of JP to write to office of the registrar interpreting the ruling and the instructions to delete them from the party’s list,” said Nderitu.

Yesterday, Tuju confirmed writing to the registrar to immediately effect the changes against the six nominated senators.

The six found themselves in bad books with the party that accused them of being disloyal.

The senators failed to turn up for the Senate Parliamentary Group meeting convened by the president in State House Nairobi to endorse the removal of senators Kipchumba Murkomen (Elgeyo/Marakwet) and Susan Kihika (Nakuru) as majority leader and majority whip, respectively, in June last year.

Mwaura was accused of advancing the ideologies of United Democratic Alliance (UDA) alongside the DP and other Tangatanga MPs.

In the expulsion letter dated February 8, Tuju stated, “The NMC of JP met today and deliberated on reports submitted by the Party Disciplinary Committee with respect to the senators who have appeared before them this year and last year on disciplinary violations as per Article 13 of the JP constitution.”

The NMC, Tuju said, was exercising its mandate as provided for under Article 7(2A) of the party constitution and, relying on other enabling provisions of the party constitution, resolved to expel the senators.

He said expulsion was to be effected immediately and communicated to the Senate speaker and the Registrar of Political Parties.

Liberty to appeal

He added that the affected senators were at liberty to appeal.

Once the registrar effects the changes, she will then write to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) stating the changes to allow it refer back to the party list and nominate others.

Nomination lists from political parties submitted to the IEBC before the General Election are closed and, therefore, the concerned party cannot nominate other people outside the list.

“IEBC will pick from the party list and Gazette notice just the same way the registrar will do on the changes. It is within the rights of the nominees to vacate their nomination or be nominated, despite being in breach of the requirements like gender and regional balance,” said a senior official at the office of the registrar.

Likewise, the officer said, “The expelled members can still move to the High Court to challenge their removal. It is not cast in stone. They still have room to exhaust all the available legal channels.”

A sharp division has emerged among ODM MPs over a push to effect amendments to the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020 in Parliament.

Some insiders confided in the Sunday Standard that there were divisions within ODM leader Raila Odinga’s camp, with some lawmakers faulting contents of the Bill, especially on proposed creation of 70 constituencies where they claim Luo Nyanza region was shortchanged.

Raila even reportedly called ODM Chairman John Mbadi and Elections Director Junet Mohammed to rally members in the National Assembly to back the Bill in its totality.

The party is divided into a wing of radicals pushing for the Bill to be tabled in Parliament without any amendments made to it and one that supports changes. The first wing is led by Junet and Mbadi.

The lawmakers are for the idea that the Bill should be tabled in Parliament and dispensed with as soon as possible so that the country can go to a referendum.

Limited role

The two diverging positions that the party has taken on the Bill was apparent as the House debated adding the joint Justice and Legal Affairs Committee more time to compile the report before it is tabled in parliament as the Bill goes to a second reading.

Subscribe to Our Newsletter Subscribe to our newsletter and stay updated on the latest developments and special offers!

While Junet and Mbadi were against the idea of the Bill going another week before it is tabled, other colleagues such as Kisumu West MP Olago Aluoch, Jared Okelo (Nyando), TJ Kajwang (Ruaraka), Peter Kaluma (Homa Bay Town) and Siaya Senator James Orengo supported giving the joint committee more time to consider public views.

TJ said Parliament had a duty under article 95 and 96 to re-look the Bill.

“I get worried when I hear members speak as if they are not members of this House. When you say you are ceremonial yet the constitution has Articles 94, 95 and 96,” he said.

“We will deal with it as National Assembly, we have a voice. How we deal with this thing is what we have charged the committee to let us know. So you can’t say we are ceremonial, you cannot speak politics when we are speaking parliamentary language,” he added.

Orengo led the ODM charge in the Senate to have the committee take another week to finalise on the report.

He said Parliament played a limited role during the 2010 constitutional process and the same should not happen now.

Garissa Township MP Aden Duale suggested that part of the unease with the BBI in Parliament had to do with ODM’s uncertainty about having Raila as Uhuru’s successor in next year’s polls.

But Okelo felt there was meddling in the process.

“All MPs subscribe to political parties that took their views before several committees, so to interfere at this point in time feeds into what we were told that there were members of the Executive out to meddle with the affairs of this constitution making process and we reject that kind of move,” he said.

Orengo, while denying there was any attempt to hijack the BBI process as Okello claimed, gave the clearest indication yet that Parliament would seek to assert itself in the process.

“After the Constitution of Kenya Bill went through the experts wasn’t it brought to Parliament? It was and the House debated it and proposed amendments. Therefore, it is not something that you can wish away,” said the senator.

Nasa coalition yesterday had a Parliamentary Group meeting at Parliament grounds and some of the discussions revolved around the joint committee.

Shortchanged

Some members want the document amended by Parliament and feel especially shortchanged by the allocation of constituencies to counties.

“In my view, Parliament is not a voting machine, it has a duty to the people so the when there is an issue before it the people will want to hear what Parliament says about it,” said Orengo.

“We have a precedent which was established by the same committee of experts which came out with this provision. What Parliament does about it the Constitution has already spelled out.”

Homa Bay Senator Moses Kajwang, speaking on KTN News, denied any concerns within ODM concerning the Bill, but indicated that his county should have gotten two additional constituencies.

“ODM fully supports the BBI. I have two constituencies that are really vast, Ndhiwa and Karachuonyo that should have been split,” said Kajwang.

Mbadi said Parliament has little role on the passage of the Bill and therefore cannot effect any changes as stipulated in Article 257 of the Constitution.

He differed with Orengo on the process by CoE that tabled a report in Parliament to make amendments.

“Even the Naivasha deliberations were not implemented because the House failed to raise the two-thirds requirement,” said Mbadi.

“We should not seek changes for political expediency. We cannot circumvent the law. Parliament role is zero. If we are unhappy we can initiate another amendment later.”",Politics,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

His heart is broken, but no one knows. He must keep up the stolid persona he has sold to the public. To them, he is –and must remain–a rebel lest the elders banish him.

Instead of letting all the pain out, he bottles it up. And he is right to do so. The last time Malala (pictured) expressed his feelings, everyone called him a crybaby.

The paparazzi captured the first teardrop leaving his eye that September day last year and tracked it as it coursed down his formerly chubby cheek and caught it as it landed into his waiting palm. They followed the second and the third tears, clicking away until his face was a mushy mess.

That evening Malala had to watch himself choke on his words after he was ‘falsely accused’ of faking his arrest. The entire country watched as his colleagues exchanged awkward glances, unsure of whether to hand him a tissue or offer comfort.

Doubtlessly, the Kakamega Senator wouldn’t want a repeat of that. What would his elders back home think of him if he cried a second time, he must have wondered.

So he took his recent sacking as the Senate’s deputy minority leader in stride to prove to elders that he had been raised well in the way of ugali and ingokho, and that he hadn’t been converted into eating rice by those in the big city.

In all the stare-downs between himself and the cameras, Malala has brandished his white, straight teeth, smiling from cheek to cheek. At times he has smiled so hard that he seems to be hurting his face. His eyes, surprise-surprise, have stayed dry.

Word has it that it would take more than his plastic smile to convince those who speak to the Mulembe gods directly that the former thespian was as hardy as they make their men.

Malala had almost convinced them following his altercation with a policeman during the Matungu by-election over some money he claimed the officer was stealing from him.

Reliable sources intimate that the elders had made arrangements to reward the son of their soil with a burnt offering, in honour of his heroics. They, however, cancelled their plans when they watched a video clip of the scene after noticing tears teetering on the edge of his eyelids, and that bodily features that should have stayed hidden were visible during his struggle the altercation.

But they may soon give him a pass, given that the universe is conspiring in Malala’s favour courtesy of the third Covid-19 wave. First, the ban on gatherings will limit the senator’s appearances in public.

He may decide to weep in private and keep up the strong act out here. The waterworks would not end up in public and the elders would never learn of his teary nature.

Then there is the fact that Malala would, most likely, not be gracing Bunge any time soon. That should insulate him from the heartrending tribute–for which Malala is famous–his colleagues would accord him and have him recall his tears.

But, more importantly, closing Bunge will keep him from seeing the cafeteria–the venue of the Wednesday meeting that sealed his fate–and hence keep him from topping up his cup of tea with his tears that are never in short supply.

The High Court has erected a new hurdle in the quest to amend the Constitution by barring the assenting of the Constitutional (Amendment) Bill by the president should the bicameral parliament endorse it.

Should President Uhuru Kenyatta go ahead and assent to the Bill, a five-judge bench ruled, the amendments shall not come into force until the determination of the petitions challenging the process.

The ruling by the bench sitting in Nakuru is a fresh blow to the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) that has been pushing for the first amendment of the Constitution ahead of the 2022 General Election.

Last month, the court also barred the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) from conducting a referendum until the litigation is finalised.

President Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga are behind the move to amend the Constitution.

They argue that the proposed changes to the supreme law would help unite the country and ensure that violence does not occur every five years during and after polls.

Yesterday, Justices Joel Ngugi, George Odunga, Jairus Ngaah, Chacha Mwita and Teresiah Matheka issued the orders following an application by Thirdway Alliance a week ago.

The Bill is already active in both the National Assembly and the Senate, which are supposed to discuss and ratify it before it is taken to the next step.

Thirdway Alliance had made the application under a certificate of urgency, arguing that there was a likelihood the Bill would not be subjected to a referendum and instead have it assented to by the president.

County assemblies

Thirdway Alliance lawyers had earlier applied to have the National Assembly and the Senate be barred from acting on the resolutions by county assemblies.

“The applicants are apprehensive that the prevailing Constitutional Amendment Bill will be approved and forwarded to the president for assent and publication...before judgement of the consolidated petitions,” read the ruling.

Thirdway said once the president assents to the Constitutional Amendment Bill, it shall become not only law but also part and parcel of the Constitution. The petitioners argued that the president may exploit the loophole to defeat orders barring IEBC from conducting a referendum.

“We will compete in Bonchari and still work together on the handshake agenda. I see no contradiction. We are strengthening ourselves as a party and preparing to compete everywhere in the country,” Sifuna said.

Jubilee vice-chairman David Murathe on Wednesday said they are ready for the by-election.

“Bonchari parliamentary seat wasn’t ODM’s. We have not done anything wrong in fielding a candidate. Last elections we were the runner-up; we want to become number one now,” he said.

In the recent past, there have been major alignments in the region with the formation of three political camps – one aligned to Raila, a second supporting Ruto and another rallying behind President Kenyatta through Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangi.

A must-win

Insiders within ODM say this is a must-win parliamentary seat. The party didn’t win a single parliamentary seat in Kisii and Nyamira counties in the 2017 General Election.

According to the UDA constitution, a presidential nominee has the exclusive right to pick a running mate after getting the nod of the National Delegates Conference (NDC).

This is unlike in the Jubilee constitution that requires the presidential candidate and his/her running mate to be nominated jointly at the NDC.

The UDA party leader will not be the automatic presidential candidate. The constitution allows members to pick anyone to fly the party’s flag.

The constitution further states that one shall be required to obtain more than 50 per cent of the NDC votes to be the presidential candidate.

“Where, however, no contestant obtains more than 50 per cent of the votes cast, there shall be a re-run between the first two contestants and the contestant with a simple majority shall be the party’s presidential candidate,” it reads in part.

The UDA constitution provides for three deputy party leaders, three deputy chairpersons, three party deputy secretary generals, three deputy national treasurers and three national organising secretaries.

Legislators said this will ensure inclusivity and equal representation of leaders from across the country.

Clearly defined role

Each of the deputies will have a clearly defined role — from political affairs, administration, operations, programmes, fundraising and strategy.

Members have a bigger say in managing party affairs to avoid concentration of powers at the top.

The party constitution gives members powers to petition for a Special Delegates Convention while the parliamentary leadership can hold meetings which do not have to attended by the party leader.

This seems to have been informed by what the DP and his allies have gone through in the ruling coalition where most of the Tangatanga leaders have been sidelined, ejected from parliamentary committees and even stripped off their leadership roles in the Jubilee Party.

The constitution has put more emphasis on the participation of ordinary members running its affairs from the polling stations all the way to the national level.

The law seems to borrow from Ruto’s mantra of “ Kazi ni Kazi”- putting the interests of mwananchi first.

Analysts say the constitution gives the clearest indication yet that Ruto will use the UDA vehicle in elections to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta.

“The policies, slogan, the symbol and the way that constitution reads is a clear reflection of Ruto’s manifesto for Kenya as he seeks the presidency in 2022,” said Gitile Naituli, a professor of management and leadership at Multimedia University.

Prof Naituli observes that Ruto’s tribulations can be traced back to failure by Jubilee constitution to empower members to hold its leadership to account.

UDA’s constitution provides for the establishment of a disciplinary committee at the national level unlike Jubilee’s which provides for the establishment of a similar organ at the county level.

No power to suspend

“Members of the County Disciplinary Committee shall be appointed by the secretary general of the party from a list presented by the National Executive Committee,” the Jubilee constitution states.

“The County Disciplinary Committee shall have the power to fine, remove the whip, suspend, or recommend expulsion of any member or office bearer in a county, constituency, ward and polling centre committee.

“Such suspension or recommendation for expulsion shall be reported to the National Executive Committee for adoption, ratification or variation,” Jubilee constitution states.

That is different from UDA’s constitution which states that all discipline matters can only be handled by the national committee.

“The county, constituency, ward offices shall have no power to suspend or expel a member of the party. Where an issue of discipline is referred to the county, constituency and ward, it shall submit the same to the Disciplinary Committee,” UDA constitution states in part.

Although Jubilee and UDA constitutions provide that the parties’ dissolution must be approved by at least two thirds of the NDC, Jubilee party is not specific on how the process is to be conducted.

“A resolution to dissolve the party shall be supported by at least two-thirds of the delegates eligible to attend and vote. Voting shall be by secret ballot only,” UDA constitution states. The secret ballot is meant to save members from being influenced to vote in a particular way.",Politics,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

Two political heavyweights seem to be gravitating towards each other after they separately ran into headwinds in their relationship with the president and his allies.

Yesterday, Deputy President William Ruto suggested that he was open to a political alliance with ODM leader Raila Odinga in the run-up to the 2022 General Election.

Ruto and Raila worked together during the 2007 General Election. Raila’s brother Oburu Oginga, earlier this month, said there was nothing stopping the two politicians from working together.

The trigger to the fresh political posturing seems to be a push for regional parties, including one for Coast region, which the President reportedly backed during a meeting with three governors from the area.

Yesterday, Ruto claimed that some powerful individuals were pushing for formation of “tribal political parties” as part of a larger political scheme to frustrate his presidential ambition and that of ODM leader Raila Odinga, by blackmailing them into backing certain regional leaders.

Speaking during an interview on Radio Citizen, the DP indicated that he was ready to exit Jubilee Party and contest for the presidency on United Democratic Alliance (UDA) party ticket, citing the sustained push to have him and his allies kicked out of the ruling party.

Blackmailed into endorsing

“They have openly said that they don’t want some of us. If it gets there and there are no chances of us agreeing, then we will join UDA. This is a party we know that we have worked with. The same way we built Jubilee into a national party, we will use the same experience to build UDA into a national party,” he added.

At the same time, ODM said it will not be blackmailed into endorsing political leaders coalescing around perceived tribal bases.

National Super Alliance (NASA) co-principals have been pushing Raila to back one of them, and have consequently ganged up to form One Kenya Alliance after he rebuffed their demands.

The Orange party declared that no formation will win the presidency without the support of either Ruto or Raila in 2022 elections.

The latest implosion has been triggered by claims that some senior state operatives are trying to prop up the emerging coalition that brings together Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi, Ford Kenya’s Moses Wetangúla, Baringo Senator and Kanu boss Gideon Moi and their Wiper counterpart Kalonzo Musyoka.

This comes a day after the president held a meeting with governors Ali Joho (Mombasa), Amason Kingi (Kilifi) and Salim Mvurya (Kwale) at State House, Nairobi, where talk of formation of a coastal party reportedly featured.

The plan, according to some quarters, entails locking out Raila from his perceived strongholds of Coast and Western by propping up regional kingpins.

The scheme also seeks to block Ruto from penetrating the regions to dent his national support base. Already, Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa has indicated he could soon ditch Ruto in favour of Mudavadi.

Some of the Coast governors, especially Kingi, have been agitating for formation of a regional outfit, a move that could weaken ODM’s support in the region.

“Currently, there is clamour to form tribal political parties. Ford Kenya is being told to be a party for Western; people are told they have to be members of ANC. In Ukambani they are told to be all in Wiper,” said Ruto.

“In Coast, they are being pushed to form their regional party. Those pushing them to form tribal parties want Kenya to go back to the era of tribal politics. They are the enemies of this country,” the DP said.

The DP ruled out working with leaders pushing for formation of regional parties, saying the only outfit with a national outlook was ODM, further giving another indication that he could consider working with Raila.

“Those we cannot work with are those who want to take us back to tribal political parties. Anybody who is ready to work with us to fight poverty and unemployment is welcome. We are ready to work with anybody,” he said.

“Many people think that we have differences with Raila, these are political differences. Where I agree with him is that we both believe in national political parties. His other colleagues don’t believe in national parties, they believe in tribal political parties, where you form a tribal party and join hands with another tribal party,” he added.

And in a statement yesterday, ODM Secretary General Edwin Sifuna said Raila was already working on a new alliance and ruled out working with politicians trying to blackmail him into endorsing their presidential ambition.

He said the party has resolved to drop tribal politicians whose focus over the years has been “what they can extract from our sweat, and from the country.”

“Our record of building coalitions, building bridges with perceived enemies and propping up younger and energetic leaders speaks for itself. We are working on one again,” said Mr Sifuna.

Realignments

“Party supporters and members need to look forward to a new order and let those coalescing around their perceived tribal bases in the hopes of blackmailing others to endorse them be,” he added.

Mudavadi, Kalonzo and Wetangúla have been pushing Raila to back one of them on the basis of their NASA pre-election agreement where the ODM leader was to serve one term then back one of the partners for the top seat. Raila did not win the 2017 presidential election.

ODM chairman John Mbadi said those seeking to form alliances that involve parties that cannot win elections beyond one community were wasting their time.

He maintained that it is only the formations by Raila and Ruto that will shape President Uhuru Kenyatta’s succession.

“What is going to come out of 2022 is not yet clear now. There are going to be realignments. But what we want to repeat is that any formation without Raila or Ruto will not win the presidency,” he said.

But Cotu boss Francis Atwoli dismissed claims that Uhuru was out to undermine certain politicians while propping others in his succession plan.

Mr Atwoli said that those forming political parties with hopes of getting to the negotiating table should go back to the drawing board as having an outfit alone is not enough.

“People think that if they have a party then they will have to sit on the high table. First and foremost, you must have people. People can from party but still tantamount to nothing,” he said.

“I don’t think Uhuru has any plan to undermine anybody, his focus now is on the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI). The problem we have is that there are people who want immediate results. Politics is not like that. It is like rainfall, when it pours, the water will find its on course,” he added.

The Coast governors are reported to have told the president that the region was not represented when he met seven party leaders at State House a couple of weeks ago.

“No government can be created without coalitions. The leaders are schedule to convene another meeting with the president. He was excited with the idea of the regional party,” said an ally of one of the governors.

They argued that since they will still be supporting Raila for the top seat, the new party will lock Ruto out.

“We don’t want a vacuum where the DP will get traction. We must lock the ground with a new party. We will support Raila but from outside not inside. With this everybody is protected,” he said.

[Dennis Kavisu, Standard]

Three National Super Alliance (Nasa) coalition partners have given the strongest hint of their plans to cut the relationship with Raila Odinga’s Orange Democratic Movement.

Yesterday, Wiper Democratic Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka, Musalia Mudavadi (ANC) and Moses Wetang’ula (Ford Kenya) of Nasa, announced a partnership with KANU chair Gideon Moi ahead of the 2022 General Election.

The four announced they would work together under a new outfit known as One Kenya Alliance.

The alliance is packaging itself as the alternative to Odinga and Deputy President William Ruto, while at the same time endearing itself to President Uhuru Kenyatta.

The move seems to put a brake on Raila’s 2022 presidential ambitions and also targets Ruto, who is seeking to succeed President Kenyatta.

The announcement of One Kenya Alliance comes after a series of public spats pitting the parties’ leadership and their allies which saw ANC’s Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala fired by ODM as the deputy Minority Leader and replaced by Kilifi Senator Stewart Madzayo.

The reverberations from yesterday’s announcement could have consequences in the race to succeed Kenyatta.

“We stand here to tell Kenyans that if you thought there was no alternative, please start putting it in your mind that there is an alternative of hope in this country,” Mudavadi said at yesterday’s press conference.

Senator Gideon sought to allay fears that their alliance was built on quick sand.

“We did what skeptics thought we could not. We will do even more in the coming days,” said the Baringo senator.

He affirmed that their outfit would start countywide rallies to popularise the alliance once the ban on political rallies is lifted.

The outfit was first unveiled during the campaigns for by-elections in Kabuchai and Matungu constituencies and the Machakos senatorial seat.

The leaders pledged to support their respective candidates in the backyards.

Unity cemented

This unity that was also cemented at the first anniversary of the late President Daniel Arap Moi at Kabarak, Nakuru County, is now gaining traction after yesterday’s pronouncement.

Senator James Orengo and MPs Junet Mohammed and Otiende Amollo who are Raila’s key allies, accused Harambee House “cabals” of fronting the leadership of the alliance.

They warned they would not hesitate to severe links with the president if the State officials continued to interfere as was the case in the Matungu by-election where ANC’s Peter Nabulindo floored ODM’s David Were.

“We want Kenyans to have hope, we want Kenyans to see hope during these hard economic times of Covid-19.

“We want Kenyans to rally together so that going into the future we can work collectively to deal with the challenges we face,” Mudavadi said yesterday.

But ODM secretary general Edwin Sifuna said the party was unfazed by the new alliance and that it was working on building its own coalitions.

The statement came just hours after Ruto, who has been missing in the public arena since his boss banned political rallies for 30 days as a Covid-19 containment measure, left open the possibility of working with Raila.

ODM suggested that Raila and Ruto could be forming their own coalition.

“Knowing that partnerships are an essential part of our politics, the Orange Democratic Movement is also working on a broader, better, and bolder alliance that will shake the country and shape the politics of the land for years to come,” Sifuna said.

Then referring to Wetang’ula, Mudavadi and Kalonzo, the ODM secretary said they were fed up with the “fading breed of tribal politicians”.

“We are focused on an alliance that adds to the national discourse, a coalition that adds not takes away from us,” Sifuna said.

ODM’s removal of Malala from the Senate position on Wednesday has had its partners in Nasa outraged.

Mudavadi said the party was still bitter about losing Matungu by-election to ANC and was blackmailing its partners in Nasa.

“We must move away from politics of blackmail.

“What we are seeing in the case of Malala and Wetang’ula many months ago was somebody trying to blackmail Kenyans. This will not work,” he said.

Mudavadi said that political sacrifices are made in the quest for democracy, and that Malala was just one of the prices to be paid.

“In politics, these are some of the sacrifices that are made to underpin the need for justice, freedom, and democracy,” Musalia said.

He added that Kenyans required a unity of purpose to deal with the issues of inflation and economic hardships.

“It is for this reason that we are taking these initial steps to bring the country together under the umbrella of One Kenya Alliance so that we can have a common objective: develop solutions together,” he said.

Kalonzo said ODM was deliberately misinterpreting the agreement that brought together Nasa.

Taking shape

“This new alliance is taking shape. We are cognizant of the fact that the Nasa coalition is still in existence,” Kalonzo said, adding that Malala was being punished for being a fearless leader.

“We are ready to give Kenyans a breath of fresh air that is not tribal and which recognises that Covid-19 is ravaging the country,” he said.

Analysts say the three by-election wins presents the One Kenya Alliance a chance to garner support ahead of next year’s General Election.

“This will consolidate their tribal bases and lock out ODM leader Raila Odinga and DP Ruto from national support,” said Hezron Owila, a political analyst.

He argued that this will reduce the popularity of Ruto and Raila, who are seen as front runners with national appeal.

“However, the circumstances present an opportunity for Raila and Ruto to form an alliance,” he said.

The newly formed alliance also declared that it will not field candidates in the upcoming by-elections and instead back President Kenyatta’s Jubilee party.",Politics,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

Coast leaders are set unveil their party that hopes to lock in the region's 1.8 million voters and boost their bargaining power ahead of the next year elections.

A rare State House meeting that seems to have caught the ODM brigade by surprise on Wednesday saw President Uhuru Kenyatta reportedly reconcile Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya with his colleagues Hassan Joho (Mombasa) and Amason Kingi (Kilifi).

Sources told The Standard that the leaders also shared their insights and aspirations for the coastal people.

Uhuru is reported to have shown interest in supporting the emergence of strong regional alliances.

The leaders argued their case on why the Coast region requires a party and their fears that Joho could be short-changed in seeking the ODM presidential ticket in 2022 after party leader Raila Odinga made it clear he will declare his interest in the seat after the passage of the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) referendum Bill.

President’s blessings

“The president reconciled the leaders in a bid to consolidate the Coast base. With a regional outfit, the second term leaders championing the process of party formation will have a seat at the national table,” argued an MP.

He disclosed “the governors basically sought the president’s blessings, like they did with Raila to avoid a situation that will result in witch-hunt.”

The meeting, according to our source, touched on the removal of Senator Cleophas Malala as deputy minority leader and his being replaced with Kilifi Senator Stewart Madzayo, who is reported to play a key role in the new political formation.

“They didn’t agree with the ouster and questioned whether Raila sanctioned the same. They argued that it’s a show of sour grapes,” said the source.

Magarini MP Michael Kingi yesterday also confirmed that a new party will be unveiled soon.

Kingi had set June as the launch date but now his allies are talking about next week or early next month.

On February 1, Joho and Kingi hosted 26 MPs and senators in a hotel in Mombasa to discuss the future of the region and the issue of coastal party. Ten days later, the two leaders, together with Tana River Governor Dhado Godana, met in the home of Taita Taveta Governor Granton Samboja in Wundanyi.

Again, on February 20, Joho led Coast elected MPs to Lamu to popularise the BBI where he met with over 20 MPs. Kingi on his part held a meeting with MCAs in Kilifi and stepped up his push for a coastal party.

The governors discussed plans of a series of tours with the President after previous cancelled tours.

Raila recently faulted Kingi’s push for regional party.

“I was with him in 2007. I supported him for governor and now that his term is ending, I wanted him to come to national politics. He now wants to run away and is talking about Kadu Asili. ODM was good for him all along but with 2022 approaching, he is now saying another party is better,” he told him during the ODM party leader's last tour in the Coast.

The leaders are in the process of unveiling a coastal party that will include six regional based parties, with Kingi as the likely leader.

During Raila’s last visit to the Coast, Kingi asked him: “Why is it there is no problem with other leaders having political formations and when it comes to Coast it’s a problem?”

Kingi said the Registrar of Political Parties would not register an outfit if it did not have a national face

The county bosses argued during a ‘Super Seven’ meeting at State House with Uhuru, Coast region was not represented. This was in reference to a meeting held last month between Uhuru and party leaders Raila, Charity Ngilu (Narc), Musalia Mudavadi (ANC), Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) Gideon Moi (Kanu) and Moses Wetang'ula (Ford Kenya) to chart the way forward on BBI.

“No government can be created without coalitions. The leaders are scheduled to convene another meeting with the president. He was excited with the idea of the regional party,” said a confidant of one of the Coast governors.

The meeting touched on ODM's popularity in Coast and forays by the Deputy President William Ruto. They argued that since they will still be supporting Raila for the top seat, the new party will lock out Ruto.",Politics,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

Kenya needs to change its economic model. This is according to Deputy President William Ruto, who on Thursday said that close to 17 million Kenyans are jobless and must be facilitated to contribute to the growth of the economy.

Speaking at his Karen home, Ruto said that millions of unemployed youth must be absorbed into the country’s transformational agenda.

“How can we make the close to 17 million jobless wananchi be the solution to our problems? We need a framework to change them from being the problem and turning them to be our solutions,” Ruto told comedian Felix Odiwuor alias Jalang’o on Bonga na Jalas.

Asked why he has not been vaccinated, Ruto said it is essential that frontline workers are first to receive the Covid-19 vaccine and praised Kenyans for adhering to the Ministry of Health guidelines.

“Judging by the results, I think we have done the best that could be done, most importantly, Kenyans have been cooperative. People are working from home; they observe curfews and interestingly, most Kenyans took the advice to limit crowds and movement I think we have tried,” he said.

On whether he is a lone ranger, Ruto laughed off the thought saying that he doesn’t have to work with those perceived to be the political elite.

He dismissed rumors that the Tangatanga movement is crumbling and pointed out that he has been hosting different leaders from across the country, including Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa, who took a sabbatical from active politics.

“Yesterday, I hosted over 40 Members of Parliament here at my residence; they were from all walks of life, show me any politician who can manage that?”

Deputy President William Ruto has defended his Hustler Nation narrative, saying it is a global phenomenon, hinting at exiting the Jubilee party soon.

In a live broadcast with a local radio station Thursday morning, the DP said politicians opposing the hustler narrative don’t want Kenyans to unite.

He said the movement will create investment opportunities for 16 million poor Kenyans, who will, in turn, be placed on the country’s tax bracket.

“Those claiming that it is about hustlers versus dynasties want to taint the movement…. It is not a competition between the poor and the rich,” Ruto said.

He said he will officially move to the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) if the Party continues to sideline him and his allies.

MPs want Devolution Principal Secretary Julius Korir and Health ministry officials investigated over questionable procurement of Sh7 billion CT Scans.

A report by the National Assembly’s Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has recommended that the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) probes the role of Mr Korir – then Health PS – for possible criminal culpability.

The report tabled on Tuesday for adoption by the House also recommended that the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) investigates directors of a firm in an Sh300 million deal with the Sports ministry.

M/S Auditel Engineering and Services was contracted to install security equipment in various stadia as the country prepared for the African Nations Championship (Chan) 2018.

“The EACC should within three months of tabling and adoption of this report, initiate a forensic investigation into the procurement of the CT Scans to establish whether there were due diligence and fidelity to the Constitution, the Public Procurement and Disposal Act of 2015,” recommends the report by the committee.

“The DCI, within three months upon adoption of this report, to initiate an investigation into the roles played by Mr Julius Korir and other Ministry of Health officers in the procurement of the CT scans intending to establish possible criminal culpability,” it adds.

The committee chaired by Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi wants the DCI to make appropriate recommendations to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP).

The committee observed that the Government-to-Government procurement was not among the methods of procurement provided for under Section 92 of the Public Procurement and Assets Disposal Act.

It also emerged that a delegation of government officials was hosted by Neusoft Medical Systems Co Ltd, that they had gone to do due diligence on.

Korir was in the delegation that travelled to China although he was not part of the Due Diligence Committee.

“It was not clear who was the head of the delegation between Dr Izaq Okoth Odongo, who was the most Senior Officer and Mr Morang’a Morekwa, who witnessed the signing of the contract. It was not clear which company was visited by the Due Diligence Committee as the report referred to Neusoft Medical System Co Ltd, Pensoft Medical System Co. Ltd and Natursoft Medical Systems Co. Ltd alternately and variously,” the report notes.

The health ministry spent Sh1,740,000,000 under specialised plant equipment and machinery to pay for CT Scans. The amount was 20 per cent of the contract value paid as a condition precedent for the Government of Kenya to obtain a loan of Sh7 billion from the Government of China to finance the purchase of the CT scans.

On the contract for the installation of security equipment in various stadia, the committee established that upon receiving the sum of Sh330,537,997, M/S Auditel Engineering and Services ‘literally disappeared into thin air.

The committee’s efforts to have the firm appear before it bore no fruit after they failed to locate its offices locally and abroad.

Questionable contract

“The EACC should, within three months of tabling and adoption of this report by the House, initiate a comprehensive investigation into M/S Auditel Engineering and Services and all its directors over their engagement with the State Department for Sports Development on the questionable contract,” recommends the report.

The committee further wants that upon establishment of criminal culpability the matter should be referred to the DPP for appropriate action.

[David Njaaga, Standard]

ODM yesterday moved to consolidate its influence in the Senate by removing Cleophas Malala of Amani National Congress (ANC) from the position of Deputy Minority Leader.

In a move that has kicked off a major storm, especially among Nasa coalition partners, the Kakamega Senator was replaced by Kilifi’s Stewart Madzayo. This came as leaders from the Coast region are reportedly planning to unveil a new political party next week.

Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi is set to become the leader of the new party. Some Coast leaders accuse ODM leader Raila Odinga of unfairness in sharing leadership positions in Parliament, which they said is populated by MPs from his Nyanza backyard. They say this is what has informed their decision to form their own party ahead of 2022.

And a petition later by Nasa partner parties - Ford Kenya, ANC and Wiper - to Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka prevailing on him not to effect the changes failed after he dismissed the entreat saying he did not wish to be drawn into internal affairs of parties.

Standing Orders

“My office is ill equipped and cannot diverge into the internal affairs of parties. The role of the Speaker is to act when he receives correspondence of the decision and minutes of the minority side and ensure they have met the threshold. I am satisfied the changes are in line with the Standing Orders,” Lusaka said through Nominated Senator Rose Nyamunga, who is a member of the Speaker’s Panel.

He added: “I hereby inform the Senate that Senator Malala stands removed and Senator Madzayo stands elected as Deputy Minority Leader.”

Malala was kicked out following a resolution by 20 ODM senators. They signed a petition to fire the ANC man and ratified the decision during a Senate Parliamentary Group yesterday.

Among other things, Malala was accused of disrespecting Nasa co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka of Wiper and ODM deputy party leader, Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya.

Choice of Madzayo as Malala’s replacement is being interpreted as a strategy by Raila to appease the Coast region, especially Kilifi County, whose entire leadership was elected on ODM party tickets.

Malala was once an ally of Raila before severing ties after reconciling with his party leader Musalia Mudavadi of ANC.

Siaya Senator James Orengo who announced Malala’s ouster did not give details of the PG meeting only saying: “We met to discuss issues around leadership in the Nasa coalition. We regularly meet as a coalition and constituent parties whenever necessary.”

Malala’s removal has put ODM at loggerheads with its Nasa partners even as Raila’s party appears keen to address unease at the Coast region which has traditionally supported him, but appears to be slipping away with plans for a regional political party championed by Kingi.

In Mombasa for instance, ODM is badly divided after some officials opened a parallel office. The split in ODM’s Mombasa office is also anchored on replacement of the party’s county chairman Mohammed Hatimy who died last year. While one faction wants Hatimy’s replacement picked by consensus, the other one is pushing for elections.

Raila has been facing rebellion at the Coast. This started with a standoff on the third generation formula of sharing revenue among counties that could have seen Coastal counties loses billions.

Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa and her Kilifi North counterpart Owen Baya were elected on ODM ticket but are now supporting Deputy President William Ruto’s bid for presidency. Appointment of Madzayo may complicate Kingi’s matrix in his push for a new party as the Kilifi senator may remain loyal to ODM.

But if Kingi and his team succeed, then the new outfit may eat into ODM’s popularity in the region.

But as this was happening, the Western region, where Raila also enjoys massive following, was up in arms over Malala’s marching orders.

“I condemn the removal of Malala as Senate Deputy Minority leader. It is selfish, unhelpful, unlawful, vindictive, intolerant, vengeful and against the Nasa coalition agreement. It has a direct link to the outcome of the Matungu by-election,” said Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula, who is also Ford Kenya leader.

Malala’s ouster came after a bitter fallout between ODM and other Nasa partner parties.

Yesterday, Kalonzo, Mudavadi and Wetang’ula wrote to Speaker Kenneth Lusaka asking him not to effect the change to the leadership of the house they termed illegal but it was rejected.

“An appeal is hereby made for the Speaker’s intervention not to confirm and suspend the unprocedural and unilateral removal of Malala by ODM senators and changes made in the committees by the same ODM party without consultations with its Nasa partner parties,” reads the letter copied to Registrar of Political Parties Ann Nderitu.

ANC chairman Kelvin Lunani, Wiper Secretary General Peter Mathuki and Ford Kenya National Organising Secretary Chris Mandu signed the letter. They maintained that the pre-election deal deposited at the registrar’s office is active and does not allow one party to make such a decision without consulting others.

“NASA coalition has an existing pre-election coalition agreement given that no signatory party to the agreement has officially and/or legally left the coalition,” the letter read.

“This means the action by an individual partner should be in cognizant of and in conformity with the coalition agreement so as not to injure other NASA partners.”

Malala becomes the second ANC senator to be kicked out of the House leadership by ODM after Nominated Senator Petronilla Were suffered the same fate and was replaced by Nominated Senator Beatrice Kwamboka as the Deputy Minority Whip.

As the life of the 12th Parliament started, Wetang’ula was also removed and replaced by his then deputy, Orengo. The Ford-K leader tried to fight the move but the Lusaka would go ahead and effect the change as per the correspondence by Minority Whip Mutula Kilonzo Jnr, the Makueni senator.

ODM senators then argued that Wetang’ula, who was the only Ford-K member in the House, lacked the exclusive right to lead them, leading to the famous quote; “You cannot be a chair of a cattle dip when you only have one cow.”

Wrongful removal

Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa (Ford Kenya), who ODM kicked out as Deputy Minority Leader and replaced him by Tongaren’s Esseli Simiyu, faulted Malala’s removal saying; “We condemn the intended wrongful removal of Malala as the Senate Deputy Minority Leader. Malala got that position as a result of the Nasa coalition agreement of sharing leadership positions which was deposited with the Registrar of political parties.”

ODM chairman John Mbadi urged Nasa affiliate parties to accept the coalition doesn’t exist anymore.

“Technically, Nasa is dead, it doesn’t exist. Malala has been working at variance with ODM. In the Matungu by-election, he was violent and hostile to the ODM party. You can't enjoy benefits of a party you fight,” said Mbadi.

He added: “He opposed the third generation formula for sharing revenue among counties that was to ensure equity. He has not been serving the interests of the party.”",Politics,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

MPs want Devolution Principal Secretary Julius Korir and other top Health Ministry officials investigated for involvement in the questionable procurement of Sh7b Computerised Tomography (CT) Scanners.

A report by National Assembly’s Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has recommended that the Directorate of Criminal Investigations investigate the role of Korir – then Health PS – for possible criminal culpability.

The report tabled on Tuesday for adoption by the House has also directed the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) to investigate directors of a firm in a Sh300 million deal with the Sports Ministry.

M/S Auditel Engineering and Services was contracted to install security equipment in various stadia as the country prepared for the African Nations Championship, Chan 2018 but mysteriously disappeared after it was declared bankrupt, abandoning the project despite pocketing the amount.

Back to the Ministry of Health, the house committee recommended: “The EACC should within three months of tabling and adoption of this report, initiate a forensic investigation into the whole procurement process of the Computerised Tomography (CT) Scanners with a view to establish[ing] whether there was due diligence and fidelity to the Constitution, The Public Procurement and Disposal Act of 2015.”

Kenya lost the right to host Chan due to the incomplete refurbishment of stadiums and heightened political temperatures occasioned by the disputed 2017 presidential election.

The watchdog committee further established that in preparation for the CHAN 2018 Kenya was directed to renovate five premium pitches to international standards and 10 training pitches.

Gregori International was single-sourced by the Ministry of Sports, Culture and Arts upon recommendation by (Confederation of African Football) CAF. The firm did not complete the works as per the contract due to delays in payments by the Ministry of Sports, Culture and the Arts forcing it to abandon works mid-way.

The report has recommended that the Sports Ministry should actualize the original intention of preparing the five stadia to attain Fifa certification to host matches like the CHAN or even Africa Cup of Nations. Currently, the only stadium that is close to attaining the CAF/FIFA and IAAF standards is Kasarani.

The contracts involved the renovation of Kasarani Stadium in Nairobi, Jomo Kenyatta Stadium in Machakos, Moi Kinoru Stadium in Meru, Nyayo Stadium in Nairobi, Kipchoge Keino Stadium in Eldoret.

Senators have lauded Machakos Senator Agnes Kavindu Muthama’s win in last week’s by-election as a boost in the push for gender equity.

Ms Kavindu, who served as a member of the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) taskforce, was sworn into office yesterday. Nominated Senator Abshiro Halake and her Bungoma colleague Moses Wetang’ula witnessed her oath-taking as a Senator.

Watching from the gallery too, was Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka and a host of other leaders who had accompanied her on her first day of work. Ms Kavindu won Machakos race on a Wiper party ticket by 104,352 votes, trouncing her rival, United Democratic Alliance’s Urbanas Muthama who got 19,726 votes.

Senators termed Kavindu’s triumph as a win for women in a Parliament where gender balance is still elusive.

Deputy Speaker Margaret Kamar saluted Kavindu as the fourth woman elected as a senator. Kavindu joins Kamar, Nakuru’s Susan Kihika and Isiolo’s Fatuma Dullo as those elected into the current Senate. Her entry brings the total number of women senators, elected and nominated, to 22.

Senate Minority Leader James Orengo lauded Kavindu for her “mature and issue-based politics”. He also drew parallels with the current events in Tanzania, which recently got its first female president, Samia Suluhu.

“It is not without significance that we are welcoming today the distinguished senator from Machakos when in the neighbourhood a lady has been enthroned as the president of Tanzania,” he said.

Orengo’s sentiments on Kavindu’s display of a neat kind of politics were echoed by Senator Wetang’ula, Deputy Majority Leader Dullo and Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala, who urged women to soldier on in fighting for their space in leadership.

Fears of attempts to derail constitutional review emerged yesterday after the joint committee compiling a report on the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) requested for more time to present the document.

The joint committee of the Senate and National Assembly Justice and Legal Affairs was scheduled to table the report on public participation on the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment)Bill 2020, yesterday.

The team however asked leave to engage constitutional experts ‘to make the Bill coherent and fully constitutional’, kicking up a storm in the House.

Chairperson of the joint team Muturi Kigano, ignited debate on the role the House will play in the law change initiative.

Old suspicions about attempts to scuttle the Handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga also surfaced amid talk of boardroom jostling and disagreements over the stand the committee will adopt.

The committee said it had collected critical response to the law review during public participation that needed time to analyse and prepare a report.

“This is the first time the House has considered a way to amend the Constitution by popular initiative and many constitutional and legal issues were expected and have arisen,” Mr Kigano said.

Critical issues

He added; “After public participation, the committee has considered six thematic areas; the nature of the Bill, public participation, process of the Bill, substantive issues, referendum issues and status of litigation in court.”

The committee Kigano co-chairs with Nyamira Senator Okong’o Omogeni collected views from 65 groups and individuals over three days last week and was expected to table their report yesterday as the Bill underwent a second reading.

But that did not happen.

Instead, Kigano said there were critical issues raised which could not be overlooked and which needed experts to guide the committee on. Dagoreti South MP John Kiarie with Mau Mau War Veterans Association Secretary General Gitu Wa Kahengeri [David Gichuru,Standard}

The joint committee chairperson did not, however, give a timeline of when the report would be ready.

“The committee thus resolved that there was need to engage experts in constitutional, legal procedural and governance issues to advice on the issues arising from the thematic areas identified,” he said.

The experts would work under a subcommittee of the joint National Assembly and Senate Justice and Legal Affairs Committee co-chaired by Kigano and Omogeni.

The subcommittee will comprise Kigano, Omogeni, Rarieda MP Otiende Amollo, Nominated MP Jennifer Shamalla, Nominated Senator Naomi Wako and Siaya Senator James Orengo.

The expert’s role will be to advise on the thematic areas that the committee identified or other issues that they may pick out. The team of experts is to further analyse the Bill and the important issues. “We are therefore asking for more time to comprehensively consider the Bill and table the report soon,” Kigano said.

But MPs questioned the motive the committee had by requesting for more time. Suba MP Junet Mohamed questioned why the committee needed other experts to inspect a Bill that already had the input of constitutional experts.

“This committee is claiming that they have formed a subcommittee to go and look for experts forgetting that this is a Bill through popular initiative; the promoters had engaged experts at length for two years,” Junet said.

“When you hear that they are looking for a committee of experts to advise them on the constitutionality and legality of the Bill then we have taken a very dangerous path pertaining to this Bill,” the MP said, asking Speaker Justin Muturi to use his power and force the committee to table their report.

Indefinite period of time

The debate brought to the fore the divisions within the committee, as one member, Kisumu West MP Olago Oluoch, denied that they had resolved to engage experts to advise it on the Bill’s legality, or to request an indefinite period of time.

Garissa Town MP Aden Duale said the reason the committee was requesting for an extension was not honest, suggesting disagreement within its ranks.

“Is there a problem in the committee? What is the reason? There are serious underlying issues. They should be candid and say the reason they really want an extension,” said Duale.

Suba South MP John Mbadi accused the committee of derailing the constitutional amendment process.

“I am surprised that they can make such a request when they know the provisions of the Constitution. Article 257 was put there to stop people who want to derail any Kenyan who wants to amend the constitution,” said Mbadi.

Parliament is split over its role in the drive to change the Constitution through the Bill.

The National Assembly Minority Leader said Parliament’s role in the constitutional change was ceremonial.

“What the committee should have done is just compiled a report to this House for future reference. There is no way that this House is even going to change a comma in the proposed Bill,” Mbadi said.

The MP said the request was ‘strange’ and was putting the country in unnecessary panic.

“The discussion out there is whether there is a disagreement between Jubilee and ODM, between Handshake partners yet it is this committee that has issues which they should sort out themselves,” said Mbadi.

Igembe North MP Maoka Maore said the committee had overstepped its mandate.

“The House is doing a ceremonial role; you cannot expand than mandate into the things the chairman was winding around that there were extensive issues. He did not ask for a timeframe, he just came and asked for an indefinite period of which the House does not want to open that gate,” he said.

However, it was Kisumu West MP Alouch, a member of the committee, who threw spanner in the works by claiming they had not discussed about involving experts.

“The message that we wanted to bring to the House today was the matter is so historic, it will be subject to litigation, we wanted at least two weeks to prepare a proper report. This idea of experts has caught me by surprise before the House,” he said. The MP asked the Speaker to give the committee two weeks to compile the report.

Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichung’wah said the committee needs time to deal with issues such as the delimitation of boundaries and new constituencies.

“BBI to me is not an emergency, I support that extension. These are not light matters that can be brushed aside. The issues raised are pertinent and we cannot take this business that this house will become a conveyor belt to this BBI process,” he said.

Backing on position

Speaker Muturi gave the committee a 10-day extension, slating the report for tabling on Thursday, April 1.

Muturi said he knew that the Bill, would go to the 2nd reading stage with or without the report.

In the Senate Siaya Senator James Orengo warned against remarks that the role of Parliament on the matter is ceremonial.

“If you go to the Committee of Experts (CoE), the way they conducted their business, almost on every issue, on every article, there is little backing on the position that they took,” he stated.

The Senate Minority leader stated: “The shame of the parliamentary process during the constitution making process, which came to this Parliament, was that in our debate (if you go to the Hansard records) the public would not be able to understand the position taken by Parliament in 2010.”

He said secondly, is the issue on content. “And even on the issue of content, Parliament must give an answer. I would plead with people who are making commentary on this process, to be very patient with Parliament. We know the timelines and we know our duty.”

Senator Omogeni said: “I want to assure the country and promoters of BBI that there is no intention whatsoever by the two joint committees to scuttle the BBI process, but we want to undertake a process that can stand any constitutional test.”",Politics,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

In her media interviews, Kavindu identified herself as a farmer and a preacher having preached through the Biblia Husema Broadcasting studios for more than seven years up until 2017 when she immersed herself fully in politics.

In the last general election, Kavindu vied for the Machakos Woman Representative seat on the Jubilee ticket but was defeated by Wiper’s Joyce Kamene.

She was later appointed by President Uhuru Kenyatta to the 14-member Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) Committee in 2018.

Kavindu got married to former Machakos Senator Johnstone Muthama in 1978. They separated a few years later in 1983 with Kavindu being granted custody of the children while Muthama was tasked with child support.

She won the Machakos senatorial seat in a by-election marked by family rivalry and succession politics.

Kavindu said her former husband Muthama should be respected.

“The fact that I’ve been elected senator doesn’t mean I’m in any competition with him,” she said.

Last month, Cytonn Investments sued John Matheka – one of its investors – claiming Sh17 million for defamation after serving him a cease and desist notice.

While the investment firm argued the move was to protect its brand from harm, going after one of its clients highlighted the souring relations between the firm and investors over the past year.

This is after the firm invoked a force majeure extending the maturity date of two of its real estate funds – the Cytonn High Yield Solutions (CHYS) and the Cytonn Project Notes – to June this year.

In the extension framework, Cytonn proposed three options for investors, including the extension of the current maturity dates by a year, conversion of investment into real estate units or entering a standstill agreement where no withdrawals are made for two years and with a one-off renegotiation fee.

But a section of investors in the two real estate funds declined any of the options and have since been unsuccessfully fighting to withdraw their money.

The acrimony has led to a bitter war of words on and offline. This includes the filing of liquidation proceedings against Cytonn in the High Court. Other investors have written to authorities such as the Capital Markets Authority (CMA), voicing their complaints.

The two funds are, however, unregulated. Home & Away looked at some of the issues raised by the investors and also spoke to Cytonn Investments Chief Executive Edwin Dande in a wide-ranging interview on the state of its funds.

Dande explained that only the two real estate funds are illiquid, with the rest, including money market, equity, balanced and pension, doing well.

Subscribe to Our Newsletter Subscribe to our newsletter and stay updated on the latest developments and special offers!

“If you invested in real estate at such a time as that of Covid-19, you cannot come out because there is illiquidity,” he said.

Dande assured that investors would start getting their money once the extension of maturity lapses and no money would be lost, adding that “capital in real estate never runs away as the asset is there”.

“That’s why even now when people make noise, I’m very calm because I know the assets are there,” he said.

According to Dande, all the 4,000 investors have elected a board and whenever there’s an issue, he as the investment manager lays it out to the board, which endorses or rejects the options presented.

It was the board that declared the force majeure, he said, and only about 50 investors have had a problem with the decision.

“When a force majeure is declared, it is binding to everyone. Investment is about risk and return. You cannot say when the return is there I’m part of it, but when the risk comes I want out,” said Dande.

He added that the investment agreement between Cytonn and investors was against early redemptions among other clauses that the investors are now fighting.

Among the criteria, for example in the contract for CHYS, required investors to have a three-year investment experience, a financial adviser and also the invitation be approved by an existing partnership.

Being a private offer, Cytonn was looking for well-heeled individual investors.

Dande also pointed out that the contract is against early redemptions and don’t stand a chance in court. He said the disgruntled investors will, therefore, have to wait for the maturity extension periods or take up a unit.

“All of them will lose (if they take court action)... read the contract; it’s so clear, litigation is about facts and figures. The contract is so clear what we do in the event of illiquidity,” said Dande.

Investors, on the other hand, accuse Cytonn of making decisions unilaterally, poking holes into the partnership agreement.

They have also wondered why they are being asked to deposit cash for housing units yet the firm has their money.

Another contentious issue has been the extension of the maturity period by 12 months instead of six as provided in the investment agreement. Cytonn had already done a three-month extension that comes to an end in June 2020 but went ahead to add another 12 months, citing the state of the economy due to Covid-19.

Investors also have an issue with the advisory board, with one retired investor who has over Sh20 million in CHYS terming it a “rubber stamp advisory board.”

The investor, who had been putting money in Cytonn since 2015, said he has written to the firm, objecting to the extension of the maturity date and the capitalisation of interests but had not received a response.

“This is very unethical and is a breach of contract. The management is not providing any viable solution to us investors,” said the investor who sought anonymity for fear of being victimised.

In a letter seen by Home & Away, the investor pleads with Cytonn to open conversations on a payment plan. “These are desperate times, and we should not be penalised for investing in your company. We urge you to, at least, offer us a payment plan,” said the investor.

While acknowledging the risk factor, he wondered why the company continues to hold his money.

“The risk factor is true, but in my case, I knew when the fund would start getting risky so I invested to ensure that the maturity date arrived before the risk. Yet post-maturity he (Dande) is holding my funds,” he said.

But according to Dande, it was the board that made the extension offers.

“Seventy per cent of them can call an EGM (extraordinary general meeting) and fire us and appoint another fund manager. CHY’s is a company with its board. We are merely investment managers. In fact, our true relationship with them is that they have a license and can change the name Cytonn today and call it something else,” he said.

Matheka, who’s now battling Cytonn in court, is one of the investors who rejected the three options presented by the firm and wanted his investment back plus interest.

He was vocal on social media until Cytonn took him to court, saying his statements were intended to damage the firm’s reputation.

“We never believe in suing clients, but once you start seeing clients actively trying to undermine the brand, we have to take that step,” said Dande.

Kenneth Kasinga is another investor who rejected the three options presented by the board. Last year, Kasinga sued the investment firm, saying he invested Sh3 million in the private offer that the company initially said targeted less than 100 people only to find out Cytonn had raised money from 3,000 investors.

Kasinga wanted a Nakuru court to declare CHYS a public offer subject to CMA regulation and also issue a permanent injunction restraining Cytonn from extending the maturity date of the fund.

He also sued the firm for breach of contract. However, the court in November referred the matter to arbitration as per the Investment Agreement and Partnership Agreement, much to his disappointment.

“We are not legitimate partners in CHYS as we are not registered as par LLP (limited liability partnership) regulations,” Kasinga told Home & Away. Investors have also taken issue with the requirement to pay a deposit for the houses under the extension framework that allowed them to convert their investment to real estate units at the current market price.",Business,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

Three brothers have sued Cytonn Investment Limited for allegedly refusing to refund their Sh46 million.

Charles Nzioki Kanyaa, Harrison Kaloki Kanyaa and Robert Munyao Kanyaa claimed they invested the money in Cytonn’s Real Estate projects with a promise that they would get a handsome reward for their investment, but the company has refused to pay them back.

Through lawyer Kioko Kilukumi, the siblings want the court to order Cytonn Real Estate Project Notes, Cytonn High Yield Solutions and Cytonn Investments Management to refund them Sh46,792,603 and the interest the money has accrued from the time of deposit.

Nzioki, in his affidavit to support the application, stated that he was approached by a Cytonn representative in 2018 with a promise that if he invested Sh10 million in any of the company's investment arms, he would get a golden handshake in monthly returns.

He swore that the representative painted to him a picture of a liquid and financially stable company, which could be trusted with huge investments since they had no history of non-payment to investors.

“It was from the convincing representation that I approached my brothers and we pooled our family resources to deposit the investments. Little did we know that the representation of the company was unconscionable, misleading and deceptive,” swore Nzioki.

He said that in October 2018, they pooled their family resources and jointly invested a total of Sh30 million in Cytonn High Yield Solutions with an agreed interest rate of 18 per cent to be paid monthly for 12 months.

In November 2019, said Nzioki, the company convinced them to increase their investments to be able to get more returns and they added Sh12 million, raising their total to Sh42 million with a new agreed interest rate of 20 per cent per month for two years.

The banking sector continues to suffer the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, with several key indicators registering a decline.

A banking sector report for the first quarter released by Cytonn Investment this week shows banks recorded a 7.4 per cent average decline in core earnings per share, compared to a growth of 12.2 per cent in a similar period last year.

This was attributed to the tough operating environment occasioned by the pandemic, which has seen the country register at least 3,000 cases so far.

“Asset quality deteriorated in Q1 2020, with the gross NPL (non-performing loans) ratio increasing by 0.9 per cent to 11.3 per cent from 10.4 per cent in Q1 2019,” Cytonn said in the report.

According to the report, I&M Bank was ranked highest in franchise value from the second position last year, while Co-operative Bank rose one place to second, mainly due to an improvement in its gross NPL ratio.

KCB, the country’s largest bank by asset, fell to the third position in franchise value from the top spot last year due to a deterioration in its cost-to-income ratio from 56.2 per cent in the 2019 financial year to 61.1 per cent in the first quarter of this year.

The report on listed banks showed an improvement in Co-op Bank’s gross NPL ratio to 10.8 per cent in the first quarter from 11.2 per cent last year.

The lender this week inched closer to the acquisition of Jamii Bora Bank after the latter’s board approved a takeover offer bid.

Jamii Bora said in a statement that the proposed transaction will see significant capital injected into the lender and will enable it to leverage the combined skills and expertise of both entities. “Following the conclusion of thorough due diligence and a special board meeting held on June 3, 2020, the board approved for recommendation to the shareholders a legally binding offer from Co-operative Bank,” read a statement from the bank.

Jamii Bora is an SME-focused lender on the lower tier of Kenya’s banking sector with 17 branches countrywide and assets estimated at around Sh12 billion. It has, however, been experiencing liquidity problems and had been looking for capital injection in the last couple of years. An earlier takeover bid of Sh1.4 billion by NCBA Bank did not go through.

https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/dr-pesa/article/2001373064/five-lies-they-told-you-about-investment,Busting common myths about investment,"Before getting into the practical details of the common misconception about investments, let us start by understanding what an investment is. An investment is an asset or item acquired with the goal of generating income or appreciation. Investments involve the purchase of goods that are not consumed today but are used in the future to create wealth.

It also involves purchasing an asset with the intention that in the near future, the assets will generate income or be sold for a higher price. Investments however, should not be confused with savings, which is keeping money for emergencies in a fund without the intention of generating wealth. The major differences between investments and saving is the risk involved and the return generated.

In investments, investors take risk by investing in particular investments assets that have a possibility of making losses while in savings, no risk is taken as the money is placed in a safe storage until maturity.

In most cases, most people do not start their investment journey due to the various misconceptions around investments. These misconceptions often pose a threat to one reaching their investment goals.

Have you ever thought of investing and you did not due to the myths and misconceptions around it? Ann Wacera of Cytonn Investments (pictured) helps demystify some of the common misconceptions about Investment.

1. You need a lot of money to start investing

Subscribe to Our Newsletter Subscribe to our newsletter and stay updated on the latest developments and special offers!

This is a common misconception that has deterred people from investing. In essence, you do not need a lot of money to start investing. Warren Buffett, one of the most successful entrepreneurs is believed to have started his investments career with a stock that cost USD38 per share, equivalent to approximately Sh4,000 currently.

In the current market, one can invest in the equities market either directly on their own or via Collective Investment Schemes such as Equity Funds (which buy ownership in businesses most often in the form of publicly traded common stock), with as little as Sh1,000 or invest in government papers using Collective Investment Schemes such as Money Market Funds with as little as Sh100 in select Money Market Funds.

2. Investment assets with the highest risk will always generate the highest returns

Albeit this might true, it is not always the scenario. Investing is stocks for instance is risky and they usually generate higher returns compared to other investments such as bonds. However, when the stock underperforms, so does the return on the investment.

3. Large-cap stocks are the safest stocks

The previous performance of a stock does not indicate that the stock will continue to perform well in the future or generate good returns. Rather than focusing on previous performance of a stock, investors should look at the companies’ price to earnings ratio - This will help you know how much you stand to gain for every share you purchase. How often they pay out dividends and their dividend payout ratio (this is a percentage of the profits made by the company).

4. Wait until you are sure

This misconception is mainly applicable in the equities market. Given the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic, most stocks have been on a downward trend with most trading at cheaper valuations.

When a stock is trading in a bear market or the stock is experiencing price corrections, most investors take a ‘wait and see’ approach. The idea that a stock should behave in a normal way and clearly indicate when it is the right time to invest, is a myth.

The equities market is normally volatile and instead of taking a ‘wait and see’ approach, buy stocks at every price dip. Should the price recover, you will make high profits when you sell it a higher price.

5. You can only start investing when you know all there is to know about investments

While there exists a broad range of investment asset classes that are complex, there are a number of investments options that are easy to understand. It is advisable to start with an investment option that is easy to understand such as Money Market Funds, the stock market etc. With the resources available on the internet, one can build their knowledge on matters Investments. You can also speak to a Financial Advisor who will help you in your journey.

In conclusion, misconceptions can be costly and will ultimately lead to one not reaching their financial goals. It is important for one to familiarize themselves with the fundamentals of investing before starting their investments journey. Laying down their investment goals and objectives will be essential in understanding the investments approach they should take.

Warren Buffett once famously said that when a person with money meets a person with experience, the one with experience ends up with the money and the one with the money leaves with experience. Sounds like a win-win situation for an entrepreneur seeking funding and an investor with hopes of discovering the next big thing to make a fortune from.

When an entrepreneur pitches their idea to an investor so as to acquire funding, they must show deep understanding of the venture because this is what convinces the investor to part with his money for what should be a profitable cause.

Edwin Dande, CEO of Cytonn, an investments management firm in Nairobi, says that investors are willing to support promising ventures, if they show grit and promise profitability. He shares some of the things entrepreneurs should know in their search for an investor.

What do you wish every entrepreneur walking into a meeting with a potential investor knew?

That their first impression should leave their financial benefactors enthused. Entrepreneurs should know that they have to make sense to an investor in the first one minute of a conversation to sustain attention of the investor.

What is the difference between a business idea that gets investors interested and one that turns them off?

Is the product or service solving real pain point for society? That is an idea that will definitely interest me. For example, the reason Equity Bank worked was because no bank was serving the unbanked. A new product in the market that promises to solve a real-life problem is an attraction to investors.

Besides the business idea, what else does the investor look for?

Subscribe to Our Newsletter Subscribe to our newsletter and stay updated on the latest developments and special offers!

There is always the question of whether the entrepreneur has a capable team. An investor will make sure to only fund a venture if the entrepreneur can demonstrate that he has a functioning team that can put the idea to work.

Therefore, it is necessary for an entrepreneur to pick a team capable of pushing the business forward. No investor wants to put his money into what looks like a company playing guesswork.

What makes for a good pitch?

When making a pitch, an entrepreneur should make sure that he has a plan on how business will be executed. This creates investor confidence. Every person putting his money into a venture wants to exactly know how the money will be spent.

As such, the entrepreneur should show exactly what they intend to do to beat the competition and remain relevant, and they should candidly present this information to the investor. Entrepreneurs should show their knowledge of the market and if possible quote their past experiences, complete with how they can navigate terrible times and how they can withstand competition.

They should as well have a solid business plan that outlines procedures to be followed towards reaching their goal.

Does that mean the business needs to have been operational for a while?

This is always best because it means that the entrepreneur has tried his hand in the trade and therefore understands the lows and highs of the market. It also indicates the entrepreneur already has a market base and has something to build on.

Experience in the market not only gives investors’ confidence to put in their money but also helps the entrepreneur manage to make profits in good time and pay back money owed to the investors promptly.

Investors like ideas that have been tried in the market so they know that the entrepreneurs knows exactly what they're doing. It is therefore imperative for entrepreneurs to first start small and sample market behaviour and trends before going to investors for big money. This helps them understand exactly how they would cope if doing the business on a larger scale.

Besides the business, is there something about the entrepreneur as a person that would cause investors to shy away?

Nobody likes lazy people, not least investors who stand to lose money if the entrepreneurs are lax. Investors therefore are pleased when they find dedicated, devoted, diligent, goal oriented and hard-working entrepreneurs. This in some way guarantees the safety of the money they pump into the business. Investors will do their due diligence and get to know who they are giving their money to. If what they find out is off putting, they will balk. Obado Obado,owner of Cafe Deli restaurant at one of his outlets along Kenyatta avenue,Nairobi. [Elvis Ogina,Standard]

MY EXPERIENCE WITH AN INVESTOR

Obado Obado, founder of Cafe Deli

In 2010, I made a bid to acquire a hotel even though I had only Sh40,000 in my bank account. The asking price for the hotel was a whopping Sh18 million. So I set out looking for financiers. And haggled the price of the hotel down to Sh14 million. Through a friend I learnt about a growth finance company called GroFin. I presented my case and I won them over.

They would finance me. They said that they believed in me because I believed in my idea. I had a clear goal of what I wanted. I was resilient, and my journey convinced them that given the resources, I would gun for everything within reach. And thus, Café Deli was born. Although I was to pay money owed to GroFin in six years, it took me only 4 years to do so. I then opened up two other branches in town.

What advice would you give when getting into a business partnership with an investor?

You have skills and the investors have capital. The relationship should be symbiotic and both parties should hold their end of the deal. Draw a step by step growth and development plan complete with timelines and projections.

Transparency, honesty and discipline are crucial components of successful partnerships. Communicate promptly and honestly always. Make decisions that do not conflict with company interests and most importantly keep records of everything.",Business,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

The report, themed “Increased Consolidation in the Banking Sector”, states that the banking sector has witnessed a number of consolidation activities in the Financial Year of 2019 as players in the sector were either acquired or merged. The report also shows that Kenya remains overbanked as the number of banks is relatively high compared to the population.

“Increased consolidation will reduce the number of banks in the country which currently stand at 38, thus reducing the commercial banks to population ratio from the current 0.8x. We expect an increase in consolidation activities going forward which will lead to the formation of relatively larger, well-capitalized and possibly more stable entities,” says the report.

There has been a continued revenue diversification drive by Banks through growing of the Non-Funded Income (NFI) segment, which has seen the average revenue mix of Funded to NFI for listed banks in FY’19 coming in at 63:37 compared to 67:33 recorded in FY’2018.

“We however believe the higher growth was due to a correction from the decline in 2018 which was a one-off adjustment as a result of the implementation of the effective interest rate which required banks to amortize fees and commissions on loans over the tenor of the loans”, said Maryanne Ng’ang’a, Investment Analyst at Cytonn Investments.

The Kenya Shilling has however depreciated in the past week by 0.2 per cent against the US Dollar to close at Sh106.2, from Sh106.0 recorded the previous week, due to a slowdown in foreign dollar currency inflows from diaspora remittances and fewer offshore investors to meet dollar demand. On an YTD basis, the shilling has depreciated by 4.8% against the dollar, in comparison to the 0.5% appreciation in 2019.

According to the report, the shilling is expected to further depreciate in 2020 as a result of the rising uncertainties in the global market due to the Coronavirus outbreak, which has seen the disruption of global supply chains.

“The shortage of imports from China for instance, which accounts for an estimated 21.0% of the country’s imports, is likely to cause local importers to look for alternative import markets, which may be more expensive and as such higher demand for the dollar from merchandise importers,” Cytonn says.

Another cause of the depreciation of the shilling is the Subdued diaspora remittances growth following the close of the 10.0 per cent tax amnesty window in July 2019. The report foresees reduced diaspora remittances, owing to the decline in economic activities globally hence a reduction in disposable incomes. This coupled with increased prices of household items abroad might see a reduction in money expatriated into the country.

The key take-outs from the report were that the containment policies such as regional lockdowns, quarantines, and social distancing have led to the reduction of labour supply greatly affecting sectors that rely heavily on social interaction such as hospitality.

Continued fears raised by the ongoing pandemic has seen investors’ flight to safe havens increase. Consequently, the rush to liquidity has increased pressure on borrowing costs leading to the scarcity of credit to the financially constraint persons.

The report, released on Tuesday, highlights the current state of the real estate sector in terms of uptake, rental yields, capital appreciation and total investor returns.

Sale prices and rents of prime residentials declined sharply last year compared to 2019, according to Knight Frank’s Kenya Market Update for the second half of 2020.

This was attributed to the continued oversupply of rental properties, less disposable income due to the unfavourable economic climate brought by the pandemic, budget cuts from multinationals and fewer expatriates in the country.

Knight Frank Kenya Mangaing Director Ben Woodhams said although there has been a downward trend of prime rents and sale prices, there was increased market activity in the second half of the year.

“Landlords, developers and sellers, aware of the economic situation, became more flexible and were willing to negotiate lower prices with potential buyers and tenants,” he said in the Kenya Market Update for the second half of 2020.

Some industry players say people looking to own homes should consider doing their own construction.

“It is cheaper than buying completed units,” says Mizizi Africa Homes Chief Executive George Mburu.

“With the prevailing economic conditions, where there is poor cash flow and people want to save as much as they can, construction is the way to go.”

A house that could cost Sh4 million to construct could cost up to twice as much when bought ready, he says, while the only extra cost that the homeowner will have to incur in construction is “a good dose of patience”.

“Constructing your own unit will help you save. It takes time to get done but after several months of waiting, you will have saved a lot of money,” Mburu says.

After recent complaints over off-plan development where buyers have been shortchanged, Mburu feels such projects are now fully back to life, with people disenchanted with living in smaller, cramped spaces now looking for upgrades in off-plan properties.

“Sales have gone down, disposable income has also reduced. Spending is now minimal. But there is need for more space for families.”

Wacuka also says high income earners who are able to start a construction and finish without getting caught up by creditors in the middle should just build.

“Most of the low-income earners resort to mortgages, and as earnings become more inconsistent, or as there comes a possibility of them losing their jobs, they are likely to be caught up by lenders, where they will lose everything they have invested in their construction,” she says.

In Kenya, there has been a problem of mortgage uptake, driven by a fear of losing property to auction. The mortgage to GDP ratio stood at 2.5 per cent in 2019, compared to other African countries such as Namibia that had 25.4 per cent.

“The mortgage uptake has been low due to the high interest rates and high deposit requirements, soaring of property prices, low-income levels making it hard to service loans and lack of credit risk information for those in the informal sector leading to their exclusion,” said investment firm Cytonn in a report on real estate investment trusts released last month.

The government has made efforts to boost the housing sector through the Kenya Mortgage and Refinance Company (KMRC), a treasury-backed partnership with the private sector.

KMRC announced in the second week of March that it had so far advanced Sh2.8 billion in credit to mortgage lenders, accounting for approximately 7.5 per cent of the Sh37.2 billion they had planned to lend from September 2020.

This has enabled them to refinance a total of 1,427 mortgages with the aim of boosting the number of mortgage accounts to 60,000 in the next five years, according to the Cytonn report.

“Mortgage accounts growth is currently being constrained by a tough economic environment with potential home buyers suffering from job losses and salary cuts, the relatively low loan size provided by KMRC capped at Sh4 million for residents within the Nairobi Metropolitan Area and Sh3 million for all other areas outside the NMA, and risk of default discouraging lending,” the report said.

Mburu says off-plan developers play a critical role in home ownership. He says many of the developers invest in professionals that help interested property owners to focus on other things while their houses take shape without requiring them to be present to monitor progress.

“Some people are too busy with their lives and they might not have the time to monitor the construction day in, day out. That is where off-plan developers come in,” he says.",Business,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

The government has completed a 10-year master plan for science and technology parks (STPs) to harness innovation.

University Education and Research Principal Secretary Simon Nabukwesi said designs for the pilot STPs at Konza Technopolis and Dedan Kimathi University of Science and Technology have been developed, and the ministry is currently at the procurement stage for design consultant and construction supervisors for prioritised laboratories.

The PS revealed the plan during the International Association of Science Parks and Areas of Innovation (IASP) Africa division forum virtual event, hosted by Konza Technopolis Development Authority (KoTDA) last week.

“This plan, which provides a framework for the implementation of STPs in the next 10 years, is indeed a major boost in our efforts to strengthen the country’s knowledge economy,” he said.

“We are at a good place as a country as we now have a framework for the implementation of the STPs in the coming years.”

The forum brought together IASP leadership, global players in the technology space, and key stakeholders in science and technology to discuss the place of STPs in Africa’s economic recovery.

Nabukwesi said there are six STPs proposed within three technology corridors - Nairobi, Central, and Western.

The STPs are Konza, Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, University of Nairobi, Dedan Kimathi University of Technology, Moi and Maseno universities.

In addition to the above, a virtual STP is also proposed for linking all the other STPs and acting as the first step in the creation of a virtual workplace and market.

ICT and Innovation Principal Secretary Jerome Ochieng said the government has invested in the National Data Centre at Konza Technopolis, which will support smart city facilities while also providing investors and innovators with a platform to host and secure their data and applications.

Speakers during the conference agreed that commitment to cross-border innovations will strengthen the economic situation of countries within the continent.

Nepad-APRM Kenya Secretariat Chief Executive Samori Okwiya said the African Union had adopted Agenda 2063, which articulates the continent’s sustained growth, competitiveness and economic transformation.

Rebecca, Nairobi

Rental houses are a sure way of generating steady income mainly depending on location and design of the units.

For the burgeoning middle class who prefer renting than buying homes on mortgage, the location is highly influential to maintain their status in society. Some will not mind paying rent through their noses to live in upscale or secluded neighbourhoods.

There are also a growing number of Nairobians who opt to rent houses in the outskirts of the capital city where houses are more spacious and rent is affordable.

The infrastructural developments like opening up of by passes and new roads with the passenger train to boot makes it easier to commute to and from work without the headache of standstill traffic jams.

However, many landlords counted losses over unpaid rent following the economic effects of the corona virus pandemic. Some rental unit owners were forced to reduce rent to maintain their income stream while others starred at empty houses after tenants moved out over increasing defaults.

Many landlords gain from the increasing value of property following the ongoing infrastructural developments which some house owners take advantage of to increase rent.

There are many instances whereby rent goes up even without undertaking improvements on the property – this mainly depends on the area where the rental property is located. There are also areas where rent remains stagnant for years.

There is also the advantage of the ‘sweat’ equity which adds value to the property when the landlord upgrades it. For instance, repainting the units, upgrading the finishing, landscaping, internet connectivity and engaging a reputable security firm complete with a response alarm system.

Such progressive developments not only add value to the property but a ‘license’ to increase the rent. These enticements are what encourage some progressive landlords to upgrade their houses whenever a tenant moves out in preparation for the next one.

However, there are times when rentals are nota bed of roses as some tenants are never willing to pay rent on time – even when they have the money. Some may pay regularly but others resort to a hide and seek game whenever rent is due. This usually makes landlords spend more time and resources seeking the payment before ending up in court to get eviction orders.

There are also tenants who are professionals in causing more harm in form of property wear that cannot be fixed by the deposit paid before moving in. There are also property owners who built houses that have stayed without tenants for months which lead to auctions especially when the construction was financed to be repaid in installments.

Homeboyz Radio has been fined Sh1 million over derogatory comments made by its presenters that have been interpreted as promoting gender-based violence.

Communications Authority of Kenya (CAK) Acting Director-General Mercy Wanjau has also suspended the station’s morning show, Lift-Off, for six months over the comments it said breached the Programming Code.

This came as Radio Africa Group, the parent company to Homeboyz, terminated its breakfast presenters Shaffie Weru, his co-host Neville Musya and a popular disc-jockey Joseph Munoru alias DJ Joe Mfalme, over their utterances.

The three, in their conversation, faulted a victim of gender-based violence for what befell her.

Ms Wanjau also directed that the station should train and sensitise its staff on gender issues as well as Programming Code.

Homeboyz Radio should also publish an apology to the masses in two newspapers with nationwide circulation and air the same during prime time for the next five days.

The station has also been asked to review its editorial policy and align it with law on gender requirements.

“The station exposed a victim of Gender-Based Violence to ridicule and implied that it was the victim’s fault that she was targeted and assaulted,” said Wanjau.

The clip of what Kenyans on social media termed as distasteful conversation glorifying rape was deleted.

Media personality and podcaster Adelle Onyango said: “This is quite sad that on a national platform, you would normalize sexual violence. It is sad that instead of having a candid conversation about the male aggression that women face when they say no (so many women have been killed or raped for this), you would instead blame women and tell us what we are doing warrants being thrown off the twelfth floor.”

In a statement, Radio Africa Group stated that the decision to fire the three was reached after a comprehensive review of the comments made on the station’s Thursday morning show, adding that the topic in discussion was neither approved nor authorised by the management.

“Our partners and listeners will not be surprised by this action to terminate their services as it is the right thing to do. The comments were neither authorised, approved nor cleared with the company nor was the subject discussed,” said Somoina Kimojino, the station’s general manager.

The entry of music streaming platforms such as Apple Music, Spotify and Boomplay in Kenya and across Africa are having a positive effect on the region’s growth in music revenue.

This is in line with the global trend over the past year, where streaming services accounted for 62.1 per cent of global music revenue, with performance rights revenues taking the biggest hit as concerts and events were cancelled due to Covid-19 pandemic.

According to the 2020 Global Music Report released by International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), the organisation that represents the recorded music industry worldwide, streaming contributed 71.9 per cent of Africa’s music revenue.

South Africa and Middle East control much of the revenue, with other sub-Saharan countries showing an increase in uptake in the streaming services on a year-on-year basis.

Streaming saw revenues up by 36.4 per cent.

“We are encouraged that the world is embracing music from Africa as seen in the rising number of nominations for global music awards,” said Angela Ndambuki, Regional Director, IFPI sub-Saharan Africa.

Ms Ndambuki said it was also encouraging to see the uptake of music streaming apps grow in other parts of Africa such as East Africa - where Spotify docked recently.

“The fact that this year’s report has featured Africa and Middle East is testament to the increasing opportunities that have been accentuated by the recent launch of music streaming platforms.

""We are excited to see the growth in the coming years,” she said.

Landmark deal

Three years ago, Boomplay, Africa’s leading music streaming and download service, and Universal Music, announced the signing of a landmark licensing agreement covering multiple markets in Africa.

And last year, Universal Music signed a landmark deal with Sauti Sol that saw the group release its latest album, Midnight Train, under the stable.

This was after AI Records, a subsidiary of Universal Music, signed a record deal with gengetone group Ethic Entertainment.

Tanzania’s Diamond Platnumz and Venessa Mdee are the other East African singers signed by the universal music leader.

In Kenya, music downloads and online subscriptions hit a high last year.

Boomplay said streaming went up by more than 200 per cent.

“According to trends, many people started to depend on streaming services as their source of entertainment when they had no other source of their choice of entertainment,” said Camilla Owora, Boomplay public relations manager.

With a strong presence in Nairobi, Boomplay currently provides more than two million songs and thousands of music videos to more than 36 million users, with nearly two million new users added each month.

The other local music streaming service provider Mdundo, has over 40,000 artistes from across Africa signed to it, with 1.5 million users accessing its catalogue every month.

The platform announced a deal with Warner Music Group last year.

It is this kind on interest that has spurred earnings.

Recorded music revenues in the region increased by 8.4 per cent in 2020, outpacing the global recorded music market grew by 7.4 per cent, the sixth consecutive year of growth, according to the report.

Total revenues for 2020 were $21.6 billion (Sh2.3 trillion).

During the same period, there was a notable increase in the signing of African artistes by global recording labels, a trend expected to increase revenue in the coming years.

“The easing of internet costs in South Africa, at a time the country experienced the continent’s largest coronavirus pandemic outbreak and longest lockdowns, may have led to the increase in uptake of streaming services,” said Sipho Dlamini, CEO Universal Music South Africa and sub-Saharan Africa.

In other regions, revenues grew differently, with Latin America maintaining its position as the fastest growing region globally (15.9 per cent), as streaming revenues grew by 30.2 per cent, accounting for 84.1per cent of the region’s total revenues.

Asia grew 9.5 per cent and digital revenues surpassed a 50 per cent share of the region’s total revenues for the first time.

Revenues in Europe, world’s second-largest recorded music region, grew by 3.5 per cent as strong streaming growth of 20.7 per cent.

In the US and Canada, revenue grew by 7.4 per cent. The US market grew by 7.3 per cent and Canada’s recorded music revenues grew by 8.1 per cent during that period.

Global revenue growth was also driven by streaming, especially by paid subscription streaming revenues, which increased by 18.5 per cent.

Innovative efforts

There were 443 million users of paid subscription accounts at the end of 2020. Total streaming (paid subscription and advertising-supported) grew by 19.9 per cent and reached Sh1.4 trillion.

The growth in streaming revenues more than offset the decline in other formats’ revenues, including physical, which declined by 4.7 per cent; and revenues from performance rights that declined by 10.1 per cent, largely as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.

In Kenya, according to reports by the Kenya Copyright Board (Kecobo), most collective management organisations responsible for collecting royalties on behalf of artistes were hit hard by the pandemic.

“Fuelled by record companies’ ongoing investment in artistes and their careers, along with innovative efforts to help artistes bring music to fans in new ways, recorded music revenues grew globally for the sixth consecutive year,"" Frances Moore, said IFPI chief executive said.

He added: ""As record companies expand their geographical footprint and cultural reach, music has become more globally connected today than ever before.

“This growth has spread globally. With many impacted by the pandemic and concerned with growing social injustices, record companies have worked hard to make a meaningful, lasting contribution to the world we want to live in.

In a Zoom panel discussion on the report, Dennis Kooker, President Global Digital Business and US Sales at Sony Music Entertainment said music had no barriers.

He stressed the opportunities posed by technology in the growth of the music recording industry worldwide.

“The role of record labels and that of the artiste remains collective, though each is distinct. It is all about art,” said Simon Robson, president, International, Recorded Music for Warner Music Group, a member of IFPI.

[Kevine Omollo, Standard]

A Benga musician who ran into trouble for composing a political song in Kenya fled to Tanzania where he later earned a fortune for singing in praise of Tanzanian President John Pombe Magufuli.

Tom Mboya Gaga, known for his stage name Atomy Sifa, was one of the famous Luo musicians who had been approached to compose a song in praise of President Uhuru Kenyatta for his re-election campaign in 2017.

The song was to be used to aid the president’s penetration in Luo land which has strongly remained behind Orange Democratic Movement leader Raila Odinga.

“I was so broke at that time and I placed the lowest bid and won the opportunity,” Sifa recalls.

He got a write-up to guide his script for the song, Uhuru Nyale (Uhuru is capable), which he crafted within a few days and the audio was out. This was approved by the masters and then a video followed.

As soon as the video was uploaded on YouTube, hell broke loose, with supporters of Raila taking issue with the content which they claimed was direct attack on the ODM leader and the Luo nation.

Sifa fled to Tanzania through Yimbo in Migori County, and sought refuge in a friend’s house in Sirare border town.

And three years after living the boring undercover life, he asked his friend to help him get to Dar Salaam where he made his way into entertainment joints, and later found himself in a recording studio.

And early last year, as Tanzania was preparing for elections, Sifa tried his lack again in the murky waters of political praises and composed a song in praise of President Magufuli who was seeking re-election.

“I took the work to Magufuli’s Chama Cha Mapinduzi offices and tried to access local radio stations to promote it. It was soon accepted and the wave swept even Magufuli,” said Sifa.

He said he once got an invite to perform in President Magufuli’s hotel in his Chato village, which presented an opportunity for him to meet the President face to face.

“We had a short chat and he told me he was impressed with my work, pledging to reward me,” he said.

Within a few days, Sifa said the President’s aides presented him with a cheque of Sh6 million, with a promise that he will get another session with the head of state.

Sifa soon moved back to his Kamoth village home in Adiedo, Homa Bay County, built a house, and a resort – Rock City Jungle Resort – which opened its doors five months ago.

“When I was developing the project, I would update the president of the progress and he even told me that he would offer me more support to ensure it is complete,” he said.

When the Sunday Standard team caught up with him yesterday, Sifa had just been discharged from hospital and was trying to come to terms with the death of Magufuli.

“My music is more accepted in Tanzania than Kenya and during the short period I was there, I got more performances,” he said.

Common man

By yesterday, Sifa claimed he was in touch with his agents in Dar es Salaam to help him get facilitation and pass to attend Magufuli’s burial.

In his song praising the president, Sifa highlights the achievement made by the no-nonsense leader in the fight against corruption, and promoting rights of the common man.

“He (Magufuli) resurrected Air Tanzania, he built roads and railway, and brought sanity and efficiency in service delivery. It was such that led me to compose the song and it paid off,” said Sifa.

Sifa was born in 1984 at Kamoth village in Adiedo, Kendu Bay. He was orphaned at an early stage, and had to drop out of school at primary. He then ventured into music, starting off as a dancer in a band led by veteran Luo Benga musician Princess Jullie.

He then formed his Super Young Turks band, to which he has 26 albums and over 100 songs.

Since gospel singer Roy Smith Mwatia aka Rufftone and Susan Njoki, known by the stage name Krystal, tied the knot six years ago, they have kept away from the public limelight.

Krystal took the back seat at their Lampstand Records, leaving the Mungu Baba Twaomba singer and their siblings to run the family business.

It is no wonder that when she announced a comeback a few weeks ago, her fans were taken by surprise.

Her comeback is in the form of Usiniache, in which she features her husband and upcoming singer Asana.

And for the first time, Krystal has opened up about her life, marriage with Rufftone, motherhood and music.

“This is the first project we have done together since we got married,” she said.

“Working together has never been part of the plan as we believe everyone should run their ministry according to their different calling.

“However, during this project, he joined me in the studio; initially, the plan was only having Asana to work with me.”

Lined up for release

She added: “It was interesting working together, it was such a natural process. You can tell that by watching the video.

“Asana is also a very talented singer and you can feel the energy that comes out of the combined effort.”

Krystal recalls meeting Rufftone when she was in high school.

Back then, he had just quit secular music for gospel. He asked her to try singing reggae, a genre that he likes.

She was a worship leader for her school’s Christian Union and not keen on recording music.

Little did she know that the singer she was talking to would later become her husband.

“When I did the first song, I suggested that he would do the bridge and even though I have released other songs like Ni Wewe and Shepherd since then, we have not been working together in terms of recording music,” she says.

The mother of two reveals that she took a back seat after they agreed to raise their children by themselves and that she would take a break from singing.

Rufftone describes her as a selfless woman.

“It is not easy for someone to sacrifice their career and sit back as others progress. That has purely been selfless and I must really praise her for that.

“It is now her time and I am here to push her singing career and make up for the lost time. The first project is out and there are others on the way,” he said.

Krystal said she feels the pressure since so much has changed on the gospel music scene.

She noted that technology, and how people used to perceive gospel artistes, have changed.

The I Love the Lord singer says that she has involved other artistes in an album which is ready for release.

“I am coming back to the industry when everyone is chasing views. Gospel music is not what it used to be anymore and there is every temptation out there to work on collaborations with anyone who has a strong digital presence.

“I am not saying that I am not here to also push for numbers but I fully believe I am just a messenger to deliver God’s message,” she said.

Away from business, the couple is fun to be with.

During the interview, Rufftone let Krystal do all the talking.

Never lost the fire

“The truth is that we are very fond of each other and love to sit and chat for long hours especially in the evening.

“We have been living together for seven years and this guy has never lost the fire for me. We love going on holidays together,” she says.

A unique Christian couple, Krystal and Rufftone, as they call each other, hardly watch anything that is not gospel at home.

“You know I was a secular artiste before crossing over to gospel and since then, I have learned that God is creative enough to get us entertained fully though gospel content, especially when it comes to music.

“We are not trying to fit into secular music standards,” Rufftone said.

The couple had a wedding in 2014 at the Kenya Assemblies of God church in Buru Buru, Nairobi.

Leading them was pop singer Raymond Shaban Mwakyusa, better known as Rayvanny, whose song Kifo (Magufuli), an emotional number, hit YouTube immediately the announcement was made.

He lauded the late president for his development record as well as his support for the youth. In the video, the former Wasafi Classic Baby (WCB) signee looks overcome with grief as he recalls the moments he shared with Magufuli.

“You have left a mark, memories that will last forever. I do not think anyone will be able to fill the void you have left. My heart grieves, we are in such pain. You have done great work. Fare-thee-well and rest…,” Rayvanny sings.

Rayvanny’s voice is just one of the many by the country’s creatives to sing Magufuli's praises. He was one of the top artistes who supported Magufuli during his campaigns for a second term with the release of a political praise song Magufuli Jembe, besides attending public rallies alongside the president.

Diamond Platnumz (real name Naseeb Abdul), another key Magufuli supporter also led his WCB artistes in recording tribute songs. Other top artistes in the country like Ali Saleh Kiba and Rajabu Kahali (Harmonize) joined in eulogising the late president.

Magufuli cemented his relationship with the young generation, enjoying massive support from artistes who shaped the youth’s opinion to support his bid during the last October polls.

Diamond, who previously was seen to have had bad blood with Magufuli’s government made an about-turn and threw his support behind the CCM leader, a move that saw him release the Magufuli Baba Lao song in July 2020.

His then rival Harmonize penned a new song Magufuli as Faustina Mfinaga, better known as Nandy, released Magufuli Tena.

Around the same time, the president brokered peace between Diamond, Harmonize and Ali Kiba, to end a long-running feud.

“I feel good when I see Ali Kiba seated next to Diamond. When you see Harmonize who left Diamond Platnumz praising him in public, that is the unity I want. I thank you for supporting CCM,” Magufuli said during one of his campaign rallies where he had invited the three stars.

Magufuli would then acknowledge the musicians publicly and reward them.

Diamond's manager Nasibu Abdul Juma alias Babu Tale was given a free hand to clinch the Morogoro Mashariki Constituency seat on a CCM ticket.

Leading rapper Hamis Mwinjuma aka Mwana FA had been appointed board member of the country’s National Arts Council (Basata) before winning the Muheza parliamentary seat, also on a CCM ticket.

Popular actress and model Wema Sepetu has previously been appointed by Magufuli to government as he pledged to have his administration enact policies favourable to the youth.

Tanzania is one of the most populous nations in Africa, with 28 million of its 55 million population being under 25, making it one of the youngest populations on earth, according to UN World Population Prospects forecast.

“The president knew the influence of the youth particularly in these elections and offered them goodies. He gave them direct nominations or pledged positions to them as he constituted his next government,” said Abdul Abasi, an expert on youth affairs.

He added, “That popular stars like Diamond Platnumz, Wema Sepetu, Mwana FA and Babu Tale, who are seen as role models for the youth supported him was enough to convince young people to re-elect him.”

The Chama Cha Mapinduzi leader died aged 61. News of his death was broken by Tanzania’s Vice President Suluhu Hassan on State television.

Magufuli had not been seen in public for more than two weeks, with rumours circulating about his health. Tanzania opposition politicians particularly questioned his absence. He was last seen in public on February 27.",Arts/Culture/Celebrities,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

Christian, who impacted the Kenyan showbiz scene together with his twin brother Lovi Longomba, died on Saturday after a long struggle with brain tumour.

According to his sister Jessy Jones, Christian, 37, who had been in and out of hospital, died in Los Angeles, US.

Lovi also took to social media to mourn his brother, saying: “To be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord.”

Speaking to The Standard yesterday, Lovi said his brother had battled the disease bravely. He described him as a good fighter who even throughout the illness remained positive about life and kept his faith in God. Lovi said the family was yet to come to terms with Christian’s death, adding that a comprehensive report would be issued today.

He urged their fans to remain strong and continue praying for them, and said: “I understand that the passing on of Christian is not easy to take”.

“In the words of Christian, I would like to say thank you to all our fans, and we love all of you. I know this is hard for you and I can’t imagine how hard it is for you, as I am also a big fan of Christian. Keep his memory alive by playing and listening to his music,” he said.

The musician had undergone a surgery in May 2015, and a second one after doctors found blood clots in his brain.

His family had appealed for support to pay his medical bill, which was almost Sh2 million at the time.

“I was in surgery for a tumour, but now I thank God for healing me through a very trying moment of my life. All praises to Jesus Christ my Lord, and saviour the giver of life,” Christian stated in 2016 after a procedure.

The Longombas became a household name in 2002 and songs like Vuta Pumz, Dondosa, Piga Makofi and Shika More were all club bangers. They were known for their energetic infectious performance and their fashion scene, an urban cool look that made them trend setters.

Their debut album, Chukua, was released in 2005, and in 2006 they were invited to perform at the Channel O Music Video Awards.

Joining hundreds of fans in sharing their condolences, Kenyan music stars described Christian as a great star whose music power ruled through a generation.

“Rest in peace homeboy. Your contribution to the Kenyan music industry shall never be forgotten. Condolences to prophet Lovi and the entire family,” wrote Nonini.

Wahu, who also recorded with Ogopa Deejays together with the Longombas back in the day, described Lovi as a diligent guy whose humility was rare among other musicians.

“I had the privilege to work with the Longombas when we were recording from Ogopa Deejays. They were an amazing lot. The most amazing thing was how the two brothers remained humble amidst fame and fortune. Lovi was special in that he was a very diligent guy,” Wahu said.

The Longombas come from a musical family. Their father, Lovi Longomba, was a member of Super Mazembe, while their grandfather, Vicky Longomba, was a member of TPOK Jazz.

Congolese based Awilo Longomba is their uncle.

It, therefore, came as a no brainer when Ogopa unveiled the duo fresh, beautiful and ready to perform.

“Christian Longomba and his brother took the Kenyan industry by storm. We were in the same label, Ogopa, and they intimidated us all. What with their rhythmic melodies and amazing dance choreography, their live shows were explosive,” said singer Nameless, who shared the stage with the Longombas numerous times.

“Nobody wanted to perform after them. Christian was more reserved than Lovi, but his voice always stole the show. I remember meeting them after many years in America, around 2012, where we shared a stage. I will miss Christian as a friend and a colleague,” said Nameless.

Lucas Bikedo, the face behind Ogopa Deejays, who signed the Longombas, said Kenya had never witnessed a duo as powerful as the Longombas. “When we signed the two we knew they were an amazing lot and would change the face of the music industry. That is what they did. They ruled the industry for over 10 years before they left the country and finally stopped singing,” said Lucas.

Kenya’s premier celebrity designer Fundi Frank said Christian was a client and a neighbor, and that he designed clothes for them. In return they made his name known.

“They were the first group in East Africa to put up a stage show with a dance routine. They also pioneered contemporary live music. May Christian rest in peace,” said Fundi.

The Longombas bagged the 2005 Kora Awards Africa for Best East Africa Group. They also won 2006 Kisima awards for Best Group from Kenya, Best Song and Best Social responsibility.

They were also feted at the Tanzania Music Awards 2006 for Best East African Album, Chukua. Longombas were teens’ favorites. In 2005 they won Best Group in East Africa in Chaguo La Teeniez, and in 2006 bagged Best Group award.

Kenya mourns legends of contemporary modern music, but more importantly Kenya mourns a talent that has gone too soon.

Muriithi John Walker attracted a legion of fans, including fellow top artistes, who have taken to social media to mourn the celebrated Mugithi singer.

Muriithi’s death was announced on Friday afternoon. He leaves behind a widow and three children.

His death caught the entertainment industry by surprise. John Walker, as many knew him, was full of life and a vibrant entertainer until his death. He had been entertaining fans via Facebook shows as well as live performances.

He had just released a new project dubbed Abiki a Kirinyaga, a song that has since gained traction with his comic description of the rich, charming women of Kirinyaga County who are as hot as ‘a hotdog’.

The cause of the 45-year-old singer’s death is yet to be disclosed. His family only said it occurred after a short illness. A post-mortem will be done on Monday.

Kirinyaga All Artistes Forum chairman Paul Kamau said they are waiting for Covid-19 test results before a decision on his burial can be made. John Walker hailed from Gichugu. As the entertainment world was thrown into a sombre mood, Kikuyu vernacular stations dedicated airtime to the fallen star with his big hits, among them Uhiki wi Murio, Uka Tu, Nyau Iriaga Mbia, Njohi na Ahiki and Tuirio Twega, enjoying massive airplay.

Emotional fans called in, some weeping. They described the singer as “the last of the great Mugithi icons of his generation.”

“Muriithi John Walker, you are a legend who made beautiful music. You will be missed but you will live through your music... You will always be with us, you will never be forgotten. Rest in Peace,” said Mugithi star Samuel Muchoki, better known as Samidoh.

The Murata wa Ngai hitmaker said John Walker was one of the few Kikuyu artistes whose music is not only entertaining but also rich, with teachings of morality and cultural norms. He said it was worrying that many Kikuyu musicians were dying.

“There are many lessons we have learned from listening and associating with John Walker. He was a humble guy despite the fame and fortune that made him such a music legend,” Samidoh said.

“In my assessment, the best ever opening lines for a Gìkùyù love song remains “Wendo nì ùrugarì, ùingìraga ngoro, mùndù akahiùha mùìrì wothe nì-kù-imagine (Love is warmth, it enters the heart and your body gets all heated up when you imagine...). Then the chorus goes comical, “nyau ìrìaga mbìa, kìihu kìrìaga ngùkù, nyota ìrìa ndìì nayo ya wendo nowe ùngìnyotora (A cat eats mice, a mongoose eats chicken but the thirst in me can only be quenched by you my lover),” said a fan, lawyer Guandaru Thuita, on one of John Walkers popular hits, Nyau Iriaga Mbia.

He described the lyrics of the fallen singer’s songs as ‘super brilliant’.

John Walker cut a niche in the Benga music genre; his lyrics laced with humour. Unlike most artistes of his generation, he embraced technology and attracted a huge social media following, with some of his songs hitting the one million views mark.

Jose Gatatura, popularly known as Machete, also paid his tribute. The Tuirio Twega singer wrote: “My deepest condolences to the family and friends of Muriithi John Walker. May your soul Rest in Peace.”

Struggle with diabetes

John Walker’s death has sparked debate on the death of celebrated Kikuyu artistes. In January this year, renowned Mugithi singer Timothy Njuguna better known as Mighty Salim died in hospital after a long struggle with diabetes.

His brother and singer Salim Junior, one of the leading one-man solo acts, died at the Nakuru Memorial Hospital in February 2018. That was the same year Joseph Kamaru, a Benga artiste and political activist who had sold about a half million records, died, reportedly from complications of Parkinson’s disease.

One year later, veteran singer John De’Mathew perished in a grisly road accident a few kilometres from Thika town as he was driving home from a funds drive.

Before Salim Junior’s death, another Kikuyu music icon, Murimi wa Kahalf, popularly known for the Ino ni Momo single, died after battling a mysterious illness.

First came a public announcement that Eric Omondi was looking for a wife.

Then followed a roller-coaster of events where would-be ‘brides’ vied for the attention of the groom.

Eric later “wedded” the winner, a pop singer. It was a choreographed script.

When Eric asked his millions of fans to vote for who would become his wife from the nine finalists, they presented to him Carol Kimweru of the BandBecca singing duo.

“We are now family and I hope you all make it for the wedding. Finally, I want to say a big thank you to Kenyans for walking with me through this journey and for helping me get a wife,” Eric announced through a social media post, telling Carol: “I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with you and make beautiful babies.”

“I found my prince charming. I believe you deserve it and the universe will serve it. As soon as I saw you, I knew an adventure was going to happen. Baby I love you so much and as this new chapter unfolds, I promise to love you and always be beside you every step of the way… Home is wherever I am with you,” said Carol.

Carol’s parents were there to witness the union. So believable it was that thousands took to social media to congratulate the new couple.

Drama act

Two months on, many have wisened up that it was a drama act. Wife Material was a reality show.

And as the comedian announced the start of the second season this week with contestants from across East Africa, all the demons were unleashed.

On Thursday, a video made the rounds on social media, with the comedian’s Wife Material Season 2 contestants fighting. The altercation happened during a bash meant to mark Eric’s birthday.

Eric shared the video on Instagram and it attracted several views.

Hours later, what might have been a choreographed episode, turned into bitter reality as the long arm of the law caught up with the comedian.

Dr Ezekiel Mutua, the Kenya Film Classification Board (KFCB) CEO, commonly referred to as Kenya’s ‘Moral Cop’, released a statement announcing that Eric had been arrested for violating provisions of the Films and Stage Plays Act Cap 222 of the Laws of Kenya by producing and distributing unauthorised film content dubbed Wife Material.

“The said comedian will be arraigned for contravening the law. The Films and Stage Pays Act Cap 222 provides, inter alia, no person shall exhibit any film at an exhibition to which the public are admitted or distribute such film unless he is registered as an exhibitor or distributor by the board and issued with a certificate,” the statement read.

Mutua remained firm that his board would take all possible legal means to curb production and exhibition of unauthorised films on any platform meant for public exhibition.

The comedian and part of his cast were arrested on Thursday evening and locked up at the Central Police Station in Nairobi.

Eric was freed yesterday on a Sh50,000 police bond and is expected to appear in court on Thursday next week to face charges pertaining to production of explicit content not licensed by KFCB.

Speaking to the Saturday Standard minutes after his release, Eric claimed he had already reached out to Mutua to find a common ground on the issue.

‘Handshake’ push

“I called Mutua and spoke with him for almost an hour talking of how we can have a ‘handshake’ on the issue. He was kind to me and reasonable throughout the talk and I am happy that through this we will find an amicable way forward,” Eric claimed on social media.

Asked if he thought KFCB was right on its stand that Wife Material was explicit content, the comedian said all he was trying to do was take the Kenyan drama show to the next level.

He said that he neither planned to break any laws on film making nor moral standings but was only contributing to the enhancement and development of good content.

“You see, we produce content every day and this is just one case of the shows Kenyan content producers are making every day. To take this to the next level, I decided to invite contestants from Tanzania and Uganda to participate in Wife Material Season 2.

“We have already recorded the entire season and produced it and all we were waiting for was to air it. However, due to the prevailing circumstances, we are putting that on hold,” he added.

The Wife Material show has attracted both support and criticism from Kenyans and fans across East Africa.

After Eric was arrested, opinion on social media was divided, with some applauding KFCB while others said that Eric was simply trying to make a living by doing what he does best — comedy.",Arts/Culture/Celebrities,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

Comedian Eric Omondi has been arrested by the Kenya Film Classification Board (KFCB) compliance officers in conjunction with Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) detectives for violating the provisions of the Films and Stage Plays Act.

In a statement by KFCB, the 'President of comedy Africa' was arrested Thursday afternoon for producing and distributing unauthorized ‘Wife Material’ films, contrary to the Act’s provisions which, among others, prohibits the exhibition or broadcast of films without a certificate of approval from the regulator.

“The said comedian will be arraigned in court for contravening the law… The Board will take all possible legal means to curb production and exhibition of unauthorized films on any platform meant for public exhibition. Protection of children from exposure to harmful content remains our core mandate. Any artist producing content for public consumption must ensure that they comply with the provisions of the Films and Stage Plays Act Cap 222 of the Laws of Kenya,” read the statement in part. Eric Omondi was arrested on March 11, 2021. [KFCB]

The arrest comes two months after KFCB boss, Dr Ezekiel Mutua, accused the comedian of promoting debauchery through the show which is currently in its second season. According to Mutua, Omondi was masquerading the show as an entertainment piece and abusing Big Tyme offices in Lavington, Nairobi.

“So there's Corona but this ** has been kissing multiple girls and recording these videos in the name of comedy. Another morally bankrupt socialite is recording more videos teaching these young girls how to have sex with Omondi in the devilish mentorship program known as ""Mombasa Raha,” said Mutua.

Mutua went on to blast rights groups for what he termed as their silence over the comedian’s gross conduct. He accused Omondi of using the viral show to ‘exploit and degrade’ women, and called upon the DCI to look into the matter and have the comedian arrested. Eric Omondi was arrested on March 11, 2021.

“It's a place where girls are being sexually abused and degraded in the name of art. The fact that women rights groups are quiet when this is happening and the police have not arrested the perpetrators of these obvious crimes is evidence of how low we have sunk as a society. By the time we get tired and stop condoning this nonsense the damage will be too bad to repair.

“On Monday, I said I didn’t believe Meghan Markle in her Oprah interview. I’ve had time to reflect on this opinion, and I still don’t. If you did, OK,” Morgan said in a characteristically combative Tweet on Wednesday morning.

The morning after the interview was aired on U.S. television, Morgan said on Good Morning Britain, among a torrent of other criticisms, that he did not believe a word Meghan had said. In a Tweet, he called her “Princess Pinocchio”.

It joins competitors Deezer, Apple Music and Boomplay, which have been enticing internet-savvy customers in the region.

Spotify, which enables streaming of local and international audio content, will see artistes get an additional source of revenue from their work because the company pays them according to the number of streams they receive.

The platform, which was launched in 2008, entered Africa in 2018. It will offer Kenyan consumers access to the Swedish service that was previously available only in South Africa, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Egypt.

These moves represent Spotify’s broadest market expansion to date,” the company said in a statement.

In its expansion, the streaming service said it will be seeking to widen the gap between itself and its competitors and solidify its position as the leading streaming platform globally. The move, it added, is aimed at giving local artistes in each market a global platform as well as widening the listening catalogue for consumers.

Local artistes told The Standard they were optimistic that Spotify will increase their revenue streams.

When he strikes the first note, the atmosphere around becomes lively. When he drops a line from Jathum Chamo Suya, you can’t help but hum along.

Benard Odhiambo Okome, known to his fans as Odhiambo Tusker, is proving to be another talented benga musicians with a commanding stage performance.

“In order to come up with a danceable, properly arranged, educative and entertaining song, any musician should always take their time,” says Tusker as we settle down in a gazebo at his home in Malela village, Rarieda, Siaya County.

Tusker’s hits such as Cynthia, Florry Nyar Bondo and Jopuonj Jomabeyo have become popular and are requested by fans during live performances, in discos or by callers to radio stations.

“I conduct a lot of research before hitting the studio to produce any song because the beats might fade, but the message linger on,” says Tusker, a student Osito Kale, another talented benga musician.

He says Florry Nyar Bondo and Cynthia are personal experiences. “Florence was my girlfriend and we had even planned to get married but we broke up. I met her years later and she asked why I had not composed a song for her. I did but by the time it hit the airwaves, Florry had died,” he says.

Tusker was born in a polygamous family but says he played a father figure to his siblings his father, Nicholas Okome, died. “My father spent all his resources on his children’s education but when he died, I ensure all my siblings continued with their education even though I had dropped out in Form Two due to lack of school fees,” he says.

Tusker, who quit Kale’s Nabi Kings Band to form Malela Super Kings Band, remains popular over the years, sometimes disappearing from the airwaves, but always making a comeback. A few years ago, there was even a rumour that he had quit music as a result of dwindling fortunes.

He says people expect a lot and this is what has led to the fall of many artistes. “I am not retiring from music anytime soon,” says Tusker.

Even though his stage name was derived from his love for Tusker beer, the artiste no longer imbibes.

Ohangla musicians are giving him a run for his money, but Tusker says the competition is healthy.

But why do artistes who rise to fame fall back to poverty so fast? While admitting that some musicians live beyond their means, Tusker advises them to treat music as an investment. “Most of the upcoming artistes are after fame, quick money and living large,” he says, adding that there is a need to invest in other sectors.

The artiste, who is now planning to nurture young musicians, says the industry has been hit by Covid-19 that led to the closure of clubs.

“We have now resorted to staging live performances on social media but it is not paying as much as performances in clubs or concerts,” he says.",Arts/Culture/Celebrities,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

When Jimmy Carter left the Joint Base Andrews on January 20, 1981, Air Force One, (the state-of-the-art presidential jet) flew the humble ex-president to Georgia, where he was driven by a pick-up truck to his farm on the rural outskirts of the Peach State, where he grew acres of peanuts.

There, he discovered that the trustees he’d left in charge during his one term in the White House had not only run the farm to the ground, but also left him a million dollars in the red.

In other words, the 39th President of the United States was now literally earning peanuts! Flash forward 40 years later. This weekend, the second impeachment trial of Donald J Trump wraps up in the Senate.

Instead of Trump chasing after little white golf balls on the rolling greens of his golf course in Mar-a-Lago, it has been reported that all week he has been following the trial in a large viewing room in his Florida home, sometimes standing up to scream at his ‘SOB’ lawyers on TV.

As Trump describes his West Palm Beach mansion in his book ‘The Art of the Deal,’ “it was first built in the early 1920s by Majorie Merriweather Post (of the Post cereal fortune).

“Set on twenty acres that face both the Atlantic Ocean and Lake Worth, the 118 room house took four years to build. Boatloads of Dorian stone were shipped from Italy for the exterior walls, and 36,000 Spanish tiles dating back to the fifteenth century were used on the exterior and the interior. At some point, the Post Foundation leased it free as a presidential retreat.”

“Buying Mar-a-Lago was a great deal (for $15 million in 1986),” Trump says in the book, before adding one of his ‘I don’t need the money’ lies: “Even though I bought it to live in it, not as a real estate investment.”

The fact is that Trump did turn the surrounding acreage of the property into a golf course and resort investment, so that he is in effect retiring into his own resort, and not quite just his house.

Concordia University literature professor Mikhail Iossel and New Yorker writer told The Standard: “For all the ‘seriousness’ with which that quack Trump took the job, you might as well have had Donald Duck (the cartoon character) chilling in that chair, these last four years. No one ever wants to see that awful cartoon character back in the hallowed Oval Office.”

Trump could of course go back to doing business in his Brioni suits, or return to the TV screen in a reality show (called ‘Ex-President’) or we could even see him behind bars (convict #45001).

With Trump and the reality show he calls ‘life’, one can never tell what’s the sequel. Or he could spend the rest of his days doing what he should be doing as a retired septuagenarian: play rounds of golf at the courses of Mar-a-Lago, and in the club house, brag to guests and caddies about what a ‘great life I have had,’ like the cad he is, long before he was a candidate.

To circle our Carter story, bankrupt peanut farmer Jimmy Carter threw in the towel on his farm in 1981 and founded the Carter Center, for democracy and humanitarian habitats, that has gone on to oversee 96 elections in 40 years, including in Kenya. That effort went on to win retired President Carter the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.

Giving speeches

Of the retired American presidents still alive, the 42nd one, Bill Clinton, has gone on to make a fortune of 150 million bucks (Sh16 billion) by giving speeches to government agencies, big corporations and philanthropic organisations throughout the Western hemisphere these last 20 years, with his average asking price being $200,000 (Sh22 million) an appearance.

George W Bush, or ‘43’ (his late father was Bush ’41), now 74 years old, is the best example of ‘retire.’ He reads (mostly presidential biographies) for pleasure, golfs for leisure, rides mountain bikes for exercise, attends Texas Rangers’ baseball games weekends (he’s a part owner of the team) and has discovered a belated passion for painting, at which critics concur he’s quite good.

Barack Obama, a talented writer in his own right, dedicated his post-presidential time to writing volume one of the memoirs that his publishers Penguin Random House had paid a jaw-dropping $40 million advance (Sh4.4 billion) for, soon after he left the White House in 2016.

‘A Promised Land’ has already returned quarter of that advance since its release two months ago, and Obama is said to be working on the second volume of these excellent memoirs.

Across the Atlantic from Washington DC, 8,485km away in Accra, Ghana, we had the State funeral of Jerry John Rawlings (who passed away of Covid-19) last month. JJ Rawlings is a rare example of a retired African president who spent his last 20 years as both a UN Eminent Person and AU Special Envoy, brokering diplomacy across the continent, from Somalia to Burkina Faso.

This is more amazing when you consider that the former flight lieutenant came to power via a second coup in 1981, ruled as leader of a military junta until 1992 then fairly won organised elections to stay in power as President of Ghana until the year 2000.

The only other African president to come to power through a coup d’etat and then as a civilian democratic president was Nigeria’s Olusegun Obasanjo, good friend of Raila Odinga.

Obasanjo was Head of State in 1976 to 1979, before returning power peacefully to civilians.

Then in 1999, he went from prison to the presidential complex (after the sudden death of dictator Sani Abacha) until his retirement from the post in 2007, after which he became a special envoy for both the AU and UN, including helping Kenya solve the 2008 PEV problem.

Obasanjo also continued his education, first getting a Masters then a PhD in theology.

Having joined the military at 21 because he couldn’t afford the college fees for Ibadan (his father abandoned them years before), Obasanjo joked upon getting his PhD at 80 years old (in 2017) that “I can finally sit with (Wole) Soyinka (his fellow Yoruba) and he listens and respects me when I talk.”

His age-mate, Haile-Mariam Mengistu, who led the murderous Derge regime in Ethiopia from 1977 until he was overthrown in 1991, is not similarly honoured, respected or at all loved.

Having escaped from Ethiopia to Zimbabwe with $3 million (Sh330 million), Mugabe gave Mengistu safe habour in the ironically named Harare suburb of Gunville, his ‘asante’ to the communist butcher from Addis for military support to ZANU from 1978 till 1980 against the racist Smith regime, when Northern Rhodesia got its independence.

Italian journalist Riccardo Orizio has described the former military leader and master of massacres as “living a reclusive, alcoholic life in a small house surrounded by a green lawn, with a low roof like that of an old colonial bungalow and draped in clumps of bougainvillea; with a couple of bodyguards patrolling purposefully outside ever since an attempted assassination on Mengistu in 1995, as he stepped out of the bougainvillea bungalow for a stroll with his wife.”

Following the death of his benefactor Mugabe of cancer in Singapore in 2019, Mengistu may feel the vultures from Ethiopia circling ever closer, as there is still a death sentence awaiting him in Addis should he ever be extradited to Ethiopia by President Mnagagwa.

‘The Great Crocodile’, as the Zimbabwean president is nicknamed, was kind to Comrade Bob, the 94-year old he overthrew politically in the party, with the help of the military in the streets. Perhaps knowing the Very Old Man was in an advanced stage of cancer, Mnagagwa provided a five-bedroom house, 23 staff, personal cars and a billion (in Kenyan) shillings’ fund to Mugabe–who was already fabulously wealthy from public coffers–to show he had ‘gone to retire’.

Old Bob stubbornly, and correctly, insisted he had been overthrown!

Idi Amin, the most infamous of Africa’s 1970 dictators, spent the last quarter century of his life in exile in Saudi Arabia.

In the name of ‘Islamic solidarity’, the Saudis bestowed on him a monthly stipend and three cars–a white Range Rover, a sky blue Cadillac and a Chevrolet Caprice–and Amin spent his days in reception halls of hotels, like a traveler in transit, in the twilight of his life after dictatorship.

He would take tea at the Sofitel Hotel in Jeddah, lunch at the Meridien, go for a swim and massage at the Intercontinental, then sup with his family at a three-star hotel called Al Waha.

Karma sometimes does not catch up with the wicked on earth–and it is to be hoped that he went from Jeddah to Janahamu upon his death in 2003, 24 years after he had fled Uganda.

Jomo Kenyatta is the only Kenyan president to have died in office, and so was ‘promoted to higher glory’ to listen to his beloved Nyakinyua traditional women dancers in ancestral heaven.

Military chopper

Late President Daniel arap Moi, the politically smartest president we’ve ever had, timed his retirement to perfection–handing over the reins of power to the opposition and flying off in a military chopper to Kabarak. He’d split his sunset years between there and Kabarnet Gardens.

His successor, Mwai Kibaki, said he was a ‘guy about town’ when he retired in 2013; and stayed in his Muthaiga home with the golf club nearby.

But ever since the passage of his first wife, Lucy, and the frequent stays of ‘second lady’ Wambui wa Mwai in Nyeri, the ex-president now spends half his time in Mweiga, Sasini; at the mansion perched above the Aberdares Ranges and below Mount Kenya the State built him for half a billion bob.

Uhuru Kenyatta will be barely past 60 when he retires next year in August, as per the Katiba.

And although he has built a palatial home in his native village of Ichaweri, with the finally tarmacked Gatundu South road leading to it, only delusional grapeviners can imagine him living there. The ultimate ‘town boy’, our bet is that he’ll stick to his city home next to State House, currently undergoing renovations.

[Edward Kiplimo, Standard]

Last Saturday, a video of construction workers demolishing the first floor of a building on Banda Street, reducing the closed Club Mojo’s to rubble, went viral.

When Mojo’s was shut down last year, like almost all night clubs in the country, thanks to a curfew brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, the hope among CBD revelers, the last of a dying breed, was that it was being renovated.

But following the disappearance of its next-door neighbour Tribeka (once Rezorus), and now the demolition of Mojo’s, the last of the cool CBD clubs is gone.

And Nairobi can be said to have almost nothing left of its night life.

Nocturnal leisure places have been going down like dominoes these last few years in the CBD of the capital city. Maybe it is a wider reflection of an economy sliding into chaos.

Most notorious of these was Simmers’ Club right at the heart of the city on Kenyatta Avenue.

For decades, it had played host to city revelers and live Congolese bands, locals and foreigners, charlatans, deal makers and decadent twilight lasses, car dealers, condom sellers and meat-and-mutura traders.

Until that dark day that, in-between a flurry of law suits and bulldozers, it was brought down in a cloud of dust and loud dust-ups. In its place lays a dead parking lot.

Behind the counter

But let us take you on a tour of town on this flashback Saturday, as if you are on a magic carpet.

Let us go back 15 years, back to that last January weekend of 2006 – and check out what the club scene looked like, back then.

Modern Green is still going on, 14,000 nights after it first opened on its legendary Latema Road location.

But now it is truly modern, and a far cry from what it looked like at the end of that January in the middle of the oh-ohs, or nightlife in the ‘naughties’.

Back then, Modern Green had its barman literally caged behind the counter, with wire mesh stretching up to the roof to protect both cash and TV set from its patrons.

It also had a contraption called a juke box where, for a 20 bob coin, you could listen to songs like What Is Love? or Kenny Rogers’ The Gambler or Veronica Conchita aka Madonna’s La Bonita or Whigfield singing Saturday Night, even on a dreary and hot afternoon in the middle of week.

Across town, one could also begin an evening by having rounds of drinks with friends at The Fiesta, a feistily painted club and restaurant on the fourth floor of Chester House.

Then just take the lift down, cross the road to then Kobil petrol station, and climb, after a bouncer check and reception pay, up frayed red staircase to the hub of the iconic Florida 2000 night club.

Also called the ‘Madhouse,’ or ‘Maddie,’ in short, and full of mad madamoiselles in short skirts.

Viewed from the outside, back then, F1 was shaped like a space shuttle pod from the movies.

Like a disco enterprise that, pried loose of the petrol station, it would blast right out of Earth: taking with it its crew of bouncers, deejays, tarts, harlots, waiters and disco-revelers into the depths of space, party-goers to be studied by the ultimate party poopers — green men with glittering eyes in silvery shimmering space suits — as if they too had come from some disco.

On a Wednesday, if one liked rock music in the mid-oh-ohs, there was always Mwenda’s, Utalii House. This ground floor joint, next to the road, had the feeling of an office-turned-night club.

Across the road, on Loita Street, at Uniafric House was a pavement pub and club aptly named Fridays’ On Fridays, Fridays was always full, a la Saape in its heydays, with people on tables on the pedestrian walks, a la the club called Hooters on Kaunda Street.

The patrons at Hooters were a group of people in their 20s and 30s, dozens of them, who called themselves ‘mafans’.

On Saturdays, and some Sundays, depending on the EPL schedule, they would come by noon, park cars along the pavement and park themselves into Hooters.

One of their now-prominent members was Mwingi West MP Charles Nguna Ngusya (CNN), who by becoming chair of the rowdy ‘mafans’ for a few years, says he realised if he can ""handle mafans, then surely I can take care of the needs of my constituents.""

Hot waitstaff

On Tuesdays, one could go to Club Soundd, just a few metres away, and six floors above street level by elevator, and drink Smirnoff vodka and listen to some young men and women recite poetry.

Indeed, it was here that the entire Kenya's Spoken Word scene was born, in this club owned by a man called Lualua who also employed hot waitstaff.

Still strolling down the street, right till Corner House on Kimathi street, one found Betty’s. It was this big and cavernous club, two floors up and down, with a dance floor.

Also on the other side of Kimathi Street is where the partying really happened, back in the CBD of the mid years of the 2000s.

Giggles was a small self-contained club that catered mostly to journalist types that converged there in gossipy geniality from both the Nation and the I&M Towers, separated by just Banda Street.

If you lived in Buruburu, Umoja, Tena, Donholm or Komayole, and wanted to 'live only once', you could do so at Hornbill Bar on Tom Mboya, or go to a proper nightclub called New York.

Kenya Cinema Plaza was home to Winkers — which had a rowdy youthful crowd that liked its music loud — on its ground floor. On the top floor was Zanze Bar, with a more mature crowd that liked lingala, rhumba and other afro-centric music.

Ibiza was where the party folks – who had graduated from partying at Visions in the 90s – went to spend their considerable money, in those Kibaki ‘boom’ years of loose cash.

The younglings of the mid-2000s crowded into Lazinos, lower down the road, got drunk, danced and fought, got tossed out by bouncers, until dawn came and lit up Kimathi Street.

Thursdays, and for dedicated fans of the genre of music known as hard rock, there was the club at Norwich Union called Zeeps where DJ Collo would play hardcore music like Toxicity.

It was at Zeeps that artist Herbert Nakitare, aka Nonini, shot his club banger Keroro.

For true toxicity in the city, you went down to club at Spiders or Pipes near the Afya Centre bus station. The latter club was toxic only because the fumes from those coloured urinal balls threatened to gas us like Auschwitz.

Estate clubs

Then there was the widest Wallet Club at a corner of Ronald Ngala Street, that also housed a hotel where men could take night dates for party activity.

Now only Sabina Joy and the Sky Lounge hold fort as the places in the CBD for very different types of revelers, with the Wine Bar at the 20th Century Plaza straddling the centre and Club & Restaurant Blues at the basement of Barclays Plaza, like a bunker in a city that has gone thermo-nuclear on the night clubs that lay above the surface.

A mojo is an influential talisman, or magic charm; and with all these clubs gone, Nairobi’s CBD has lost its mojo, as the night life of weekends devolves to estate clubs and liquor stalls, a trend that has greatly accelerated these last nine months of curfew.

And back from the end January of 2006, the city centre at night in 2021 really has no-one.

For this writer, Mojo’s will always be a Tuesday evening with a view of Nairobi evening life. Pedestrians on pavements hurrying home or elsewhere, and then as the sun set on the city, the music from the interior of that red-and-white leather plush sofa club, drifting out to us all.

It will be a treat of a different kind for his fans. For several months now, Holy Dave has been trending online for his food, not his music.

His cooking show, HDsKitchenShow, has become so popular that it has spawned a cooking challenge where fans share appetite-whetting videos.

“My new food business came up by mistake. When the nationwide curfews started early last year, people were no longer going out to eat or party, and I didn’t have much to do,” he said.

“One night, I got liver out of the fridge and started recording myself as I prepared it. I posted the video on social media and it got plenty of likes. My mum, who taught me how to cook, called me and told me to do more videos.”

And he did. The following day he baked a cake, and then made pizza and chicken. He shared the recipes and videos with his followers, and friends started placing orders for meals.

“Anyone who viewed my posts became a potential client. I noticed that this is something that had been in me and I made up my mind to turn it into a serious business venture,” said Holy Dave, adding that he grew up watching lots of cooking shows.

He cashed in on the new opportunity, and has now employed several workers who help him provide food and catering services at birthday parties, weddings and entertainment events.

“It is a new business that is still facing teething problems, but I am realising steady growth every day.”

Love Ballad

But that doesn’t mean Holy Dave, who is in his early 30s, has fully given up music. His new release is a ballad titled My Kind of Girl, a collaboration with upcoming artiste Lorna.

It evokes a feeling of déjà vu, stirring up memories of his 2013 release, You Look Familiar. The emotional love song won the hearts of fans with its smooth delivery and heartfelt lyrics, including a line saying love does not only ‘happen’ on Valentine’s Day.

For some time now, Holy Dave, who was at one time among the country’s most celebrated gospel rappers, has been out of the limelight.

He exited the Bambika show on Citizen TV a year ago, and without new music to offer to his fans, he was almost written off as a star of yesteryears.

Holy Dave’s star began to rise after his 2012 singles Press On, featuring Izzo, Mara Hio Hio, which he released alongside Bantu, and Ni Msoh, a hit he worked on with the then leading rap group Kelele Takatifu. David Muthengi alias Holy Dave, the rapper turned chef. [Courtesy]

He ended up winning awards that year at the 2012 Coast Music Awards. Two years later, he scooped a Groove Award for the Wanna Be hit, a project he worked on with rapper Diana Kiamba, aka Dee.

He worked on a few more low-key songs before taking time off the music scene. And then in 2019, he made his comeback with Tia Bidii Zidi, a song that chronicles life’s challenges.

“The truth is that music, especially during this Covid-19 pandemic era, was not paying and I had to look for a side hustle. I had to internalise and get real with myself as to how I would pay my bills and make a living,” he said..

Holy Dave, who has a degree in computer science and an MBA in strategic management and finance, knew he needed to change lanes.

“My mentor gave me a few classes to teach through which I made money. I also had some part-time jobs with financial institutions, but my heart was not in it. I needed to do something that satisfies me.”

In his soul-searching mission, he quit his job and decided to release no new music. But when Covid-19 hit, Holy Dave, who is pursuing a PhD in business administration at the University of Nairobi, also had to take a break from teaching.

Cooking offered him a sense of stability in the chaos, and what started out as a simple video shared on social media spawned a business. Holy Dave. [Courtesy]

The artiste said to gain an edge in the food business, he is taking research seriously, studying menus, investment plans, as well as hospitality factors that bring about customer satisfaction.

“I have learned the art of layering. I am using my showbiz label, Holy Dave, as well as my showbiz popularity to navigate new grounds,” he said.

“During the holidays, I started an Airbnb venture, which actually happens to be an on-demand business in Nairobi. With this, I am able to prepare food for guests and serve groups of about 25 clients – a double gain from a business perspective.”

He said he charges Sh30,000, inclusive of menu ingredients, for such a group of clients, or Sh20,000 if the ingredients are provided.

“I have experienced his cooking. The best thing is that he is very practical in terms of creating recipes that are workable and relatable. I believe with time, this guy will become a big Kenyan export, speaking from a cooking experience perspective,” said Chris Kirwa, a well-known events manager.

Daniella Kamaru, a 28-year-old Kenyan living in the US, said she learned of Holy Dave’s show through friends who had been discussing his Instagram posts. When she came to Kenya in December, she and her friends decided to sample his food.

Dream Hotel

According to Daniella, Holy Dave could become as popular as independent chefs in the US who tailor-make menus for clients.

“The experience was good and the prices were affordable for the two days we were served during our Airbnb stay,” she said.

For Holy Dave, this is just the beginning: “I have an entire plan for setting up a dream hotel that comes with a feeling of home – I will be my guests’ host. However, this might not happen now as it comes with a huge investment.

“I need to lease a good place, ship in kitchen equipment and work on interior décor. All this will cost about Sh4.5 million.”

He added that since his cooking show – which often features celebrities and other influential personalities – is geared at inspiring the average Kenyan interested in cooking, he does not use complicated recipes or methods.

He counts among his inspirations the late American chef and author Anthony Bourdain, celebrity chef Bobby Flay and Kenyan award-winning chef Ali Alamin.

“Juggling all these things – music, school and business – is not easy, but I believe in ruthless focus, which is the ability to respect time,” he said.

“In any case, these three facets work together in terms of complementing ‘Holy Dave the brand. I am using the education to understand how business works and how to manage my finances as I build my empire.” Holy Dave and his sister, media personality Joey Muthengi. [Courtesy]

An avid travel and adventure lover, Holy Dave said even though many know him as a gospel rapper, he wouldn’t want to be typecast as there is much more he wants to explore in life.

“I have been working on many projects with upcoming artistes as I want to play a mentor role in the industry,” he said.

Yesterday, a local daily quoted Najib Balala, the Tourism Cabinet Secretary as saying that his ministry had tried to reach out to Lupita (pictured) for five years to appoint her as Kenya's tourism ambassador but she could not be reached.

British supermodel Naomi Campbell was appointed to the role and a section of Kenyans was, with some suggesting that several Kenyan personalities, including Lupita, could have been given that task.

""Me when I hear the Kenyan Ministry of Tourism has been looking for me for five years. #Imrightherebaby #alternativefacts,"" she posted on her official Twitter handle, creating a fresh online debate on an issue online Kenyans had forgotten.

Last week, at Kenyatta University, Balala said they had not settled for Lupita for the branding role because she was too busy with other engagements.

“I know everybody is asking why not Lupita. Lupita has commitments and her managers cannot allow us to access her. We’ve spent the last five years looking for Lupita,” Balala said.

Balala went ahead to note that his Ministry makes appointments while targeting specific markets.

“We can have one of our own, and we already have Eliud Kipchoge. We are targeting specific markets and sectors, so we will identify brand ambassadors because of that. We use Kipchoge to market Kenya because of his vast international networks,” the CS said.

While justifying the appointment of the 50-year-old British supermodel about two weeks ago, Balala said Campbell was well-positioned to help market Kenya as an ideal tourism and travel destination.

“We welcome the exciting news that Naomi Campbell will advocate for tourism and travel internationally for the Magical Kenya brand,” he said in a press statement following the signing of the deal in Malindi where Campbell was holidaying.

“I am impressed with the world-class standard facilities at the Professional Golf Association (PGA) Baobab course located in Vipingo Ridge, the only golf course credited by the PGA in the whole of Africa. I invite golf professionals globally to visit the course to enjoy the experience,” Campbell said.

The appointment of the Briton who visits Kenya almost every year, drew criticism from a section of Kenyans who felt the role should have been awarded to a celebrated Kenyan.

“What value will Campbell bring? Why not choose people like Lupita and other notable Kenyans?” wondered one Alphonse Kiama on social media.

However, Balala defended the move noting that Campbell’s appointment was a gain to the country and will not interfere with the domestic market.

“Naomi Campbell will be Magical Kenya’s International Tourism Ambassador. That doesn’t take away from our domestic market, it only strengthens it,” he said.

The pandemic brought the Sh200 billion industry to its knees. Even as the world continues to celebrate wins in the war against Covid-19 such as the discovery of a vaccine, the future still appears uncertain for the industry.

Boniface Gachoka, the secretary-general of the National Bars Association, which has 54,000 bars across 41 counties listed as members, says the situation is dire and quickly adds that the government should consider offering operators a rescue plan as it did with other industries.

“Things don’t look any different for us this year. We have had instances where bars that have been in existence for decades have been forced to shut down. A good example is the Octopus Club in Kisumu which opened its doors in 1978. If the big boys are exiting the market, what do you expect from the rest,” Gachoka adds.

Gachoka says the association was keen on ensuring bars invest in the new infrastructural requirements in the Covid-19 containment regulations. However, he says most business owners don’t have the financial muscle to do so, having been out of business for long.

“One of our goals is to reach an agreement with the county governments so that they can revise and subsidise operating licence costs for bars. A very small pub operating within Nairobi is required to pay up to Sh200,000 in licences,” he says.

The association, he adds, also plans to reach out to lending institutions to see whether bar and restaurant owners can get access to loans on favourable terms.

“At the moment, several banks have classified bars as high risk in terms of lending. If there continues to be a lack of access to credit, 7,000 bars are at risk of closure. We are also investing in educating staff on Covid-19 regulations and also continue to operate at the capacity directed by the government,” notes Gachoka.

Muthoni Ndonga, better known by her stage name Muthoni The Drummer Queen, says it’s high time the industry came up with a recovery plan if things are ever going to get back to where they were before Covid.

“We can only properly think about the way forward as an industry after perhaps vaccines have been issued to the masses and after the government has secured public trust in the vaccination process and other measures are taken to curb Covid,” says the artiste.

Muthoni implores her fellow entertainers to brace for a tough year financially as things might take a while to get back to normal.

While Tanzania and Kenya’s experiences have been different during this period, the situation hasn’t been different for artistes in both counties.

Bongo flavour singer and songwriter Nandy through her manager Werunga says that although there have not been social distancing restrictions in Tanzania, she has had to cancel many shows, especially international ones in the US and Europe.

“We are working on an album that may be out later this year. There will be some big international collaborations in the line-up. Travel will, however, be minimal as some countries still have border lockdowns. We will travel primarily for video shoots,” says Werunga.

Wachira Gatama, a member of a popular neo-soul and pop music group H_art The Band says there are other revenue streams within the music scene that artistes can focus on in the meantime.

“During the lockdown, we noted an increase in our online fan base. People listened to Kenyan music more. Our goal this year is to release more content. As a band, we will focus more on giving our core fans what they deserve,” adds Gatama.

According to Rolling Stone, a popular culture magazine, the 2021 entertainment scene is likely to include increased media consumption, a reduced appetite for travel and more focus on staycations - where people stay at home or in local establishments for leisure activities.

“Since it will likely be a long time until there are massive public events, 2021 will see a lot of innovation in merging digital and physical worlds. We’ve seen this in 2020, but many of the events haven’t been executed very well as it’s a new world and hard to tackle,” reads part of an article published in the Rolling Stone.

With the curfew still in place and entertainment joints operating at 34 per cent capacity, the struggle may last longer than expected.

However, online platforms such as YouTube and social media sites offer artistes great chances of growing their careers and earn a living through music.

In the meantime, partygoers eagerly await the next presidential address around March in which they expect the curfew to be lifted.

Last year, musicians, comedians, and other entertainers widened their digital reach by hosting Instagram Live shows and being more active on YouTube, which is also likely to be the case this year.

Paid partnerships with brands have also been touted as a great way through which artistes can make money even after Covid-19.

According to The Business Insider, YouTube pays according to the number of views a video gets as well as its advertising potential.

The business and finance website reports that creators with 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours are eligible to have their videos monetised. These ads are filtered by Google, and how much money a creator earns depends on the video’s watch time, length, video type, and viewer demographics — among other factors.

An American content creator interviewed by ‘Business Insider’ says that with 248,000 subscribers, and over 20 videos that have been viewed slightly over 100,000 times, she earns between Sh20,000 and Sh50,000 monthly.

Trace East Africa Managing Director Danny Mucira late last year told The Standard that artistes make money through virtual concerts essentially through their negotiating power, with the earnings being a delicate balance between a sponsor’s budget and the artiste’s ability to deliver.

“The hierarchy of spend that applies to physical concerts applies to virtual concerts as well. How does the crowd respond to you, how big is your following, are they the right audience for the product/service? Artistes may not make as much as they did during the pre-Covid times now that organisers cannot charge as much as they were doing for physical concert tickets, but they still make a decent amount per concert,” said Mucira.?",Arts/Culture/Celebrities,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

The versatile and stylish singer whose songs rocked airwaves died at her cousin’s home in Uriri, Migori County, on Friday night.

She has been ill for several months and has been in and out of hospitals as friends and family mobilised resources in a bid to save her life.

Yesterday, her family and fans were struggling to come to terms with the loss of singer whom they described as loving and caring.

Her family described her death as devastating and appealed to authorities to give them time to prepare before they can give Lady Maureen a decent send-off.

Margaret Akinyi, Maureen’s mother, said her first daughter had a premonition about her death four days ago when she told her mother that she was losing hope.

“I had a talk with her four days ago and she apologised for not doing much to help me. She told me to expect many visitors in my home. I did not know that her time was already up,” Akinyi said.

She said her daughter’s demise has left her broken and appealed to the government to give her at least one week to prepare for her burial. The family plans to bury her at Kopanga in Migori County.

Bella Achieng, who has been taking care of Lady Maureen after she was discharged from hospital, described the loss as heartbreaking.

“We have taken the body to Ojele Memorial (mortuary) as we plan for her burial. Our main plea is to be given time to make proper burial arrangements,” said Bella.

Lady Maureen becomes the third Luo musician to die in the last one month after Abenny Jachiga and Omondi Long Lilo also died after a short illness.

Following her death, several leaders and fans sent their condolences to the family, saying it is a big loss to the entertainment industry.

Talented and dynamic

On Twitter, ODM leader Raila Odinga described the singer as talented and dynamic.

“My condolences go out to the family, friends and fans of Lady Maureen. Achieng’ was immensely talented and very dynamic; always adapting to new trends in a very competitive music industry. May she Rest in Eternal Peace,” wrote Raila.

Raila’s wife Ida eulogised the deceased, famed for her Gor Kogallo song as one of the best ohangla composers.

“I am shocked at the news of her death. She was one of the best composers of Ohangla hit songs. May her soul rest in peace,” Ida said.

Kisumu Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o and Homa Bay Woman Representative Gladys Wanga said the singer will be remembered for her great musical talent.

“Lady Maureen will be remembered for her great musical talent that gave ohangla music a modern twist warming many hearts. The Luo music community will miss her great musical messaging technique championed by careful selection of words in her songs,” Nyong’o said.

Born in 1982, the vibrant songbird had not known peace since 2018 when she fell ill.

Behind the façade of celebrity status, she struggled for finances to support her treatment. At some point, artistes mobilised resources for her treatment.

Early this year, Lady Maureen was admitted at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital in Kisumu after being transferred from a hospital in Migori. She was discharged on February 20.

Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital Medical Superintendent Peter Okoth said then that the singer was discharged because she “was responding well to medication and was getting stable.”

After being discharged, Lady Maureen was stuck in hospital for five days due to an unresolved family dispute.

The singer’s health started deteriorating two years ago. She sought help from various hospitals, including Pastor Machage Memorial Hospital in Migori and Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital.

Two months prior to her illness, she was arrested and jailed for nine days, together with 15 band members in Mwanza, Tanzania, for allegedly working in that country without permits. The musician said it was a ploy to ruin her reputation.

Last month, fake news of the musician death spread after a dancer also called Maureen passed on prompting her mother to tell her fans that she was alive.

She composed many songs, including others in praise of Raila and Gor Mahia football fans.

Some of her songs were also provocative, with Jogi Jokuoge addressing the dangers of electoral malpractices.",Arts/Culture/Celebrities,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

Will Smith told his wife Jada he was ""done"" with her and insisted he never wanted to speak to her again after their marriage collapsed.

The Hollywood actor, 51, and his wife Jada Pinkett Smith, 48, lift the lid on their personal problems in a dramatic showdown on Red Table Talk last night.

During the chat, Jada confirmed she'd had a relationship with singer August Alsina, 27, during their marriage.

The showbiz super-couple explained it came during a difficult patch in the marriage around four and a half years ago.

Smith admitted he was convinced the marriage was over and he never wanted to speak to his wife again.

During the Red Table Talk, he explained how August came into their lives at the time their marriage had crumbled.

He said: ""When Aug first came around, he was really sick. The outpouring for him from our family was initially about his health.

Jada added: ""We found all those different resources to help pull from there. You and I were going through difficult time.""

""You giving permission only circumstance is myself. August was probably trying to communicate, I could see how he would perceive it as permission as we were separated amicably. He wanted to make it clear he's not a home wrecker. Which he's not.""

However, the pair pater decided to give their marriage another shot and Smith said it was a ""miracle"" they were able to patch things up.

He explained: ""I wasn't sure I was ever gonna speak to you again. It's a miracle. Certain things you have to go through... August Alsina recently opened up about his relationship with Jada.

""There's a real power. I'm gonna get you back. I said I can love you through anything.""

It comes after August's bombshell interview about his romance with Jada.

In a YouTube interview with Angela Yee, he claimed: ""I actually sat down with Will [Smith] and had a conversation due to the transformation from their marriage to life partnership...

""He gave me his blessing.

""When asked about the alleged affair with Jada, August said: ""I totally gave myself to that relationship for years of my life, and I truly and really, really deeply love and have a ton of love for her.

A Nigerian Instagram celebrity with 2.4 million followers and known for his flamboyant lifestyle could face a statutory sentence for money laundering and cyber crime.

Ramon Abbas, alias Hushpuppi, 37, has appeared in court in the US, accused of conspiring to launder millions of dollars through cyber crime cartels.

If found guilty, Hushpuppi, who was known to flaunt his lavish lifestyle showcasing his Rolls Royce and Ferrari cars, golden watches and designer clothes, could be sentenced to up to 20 years in jail.

The news of his arrest by the FBI in Dubai before he was flown to Chicago, US, where he appeared in a federal court on Friday, took the regional showbiz industry by surprise.

Hushpuppi had been associated with a number of Kenyan socialites, including one he was rumoured to have dated last year.

The Kenyan socialite, who is said to have had romantic escapades with Hushpuppi in Dubai, has however distanced herself from him, saying she no longer wants to hear anything to do with Nigerian “boys”.

Another Kenyan socialite told The Standard that she was not shocked that Hushpuppi was arrested as “he had sold himself out with all those extravagant displays of quick riches”.

“Everyone has been talking about the story of Yahoo Boys, these young Nigerian men who use the internet to relieve unsuspecting clients of their money in romance, gold and other business scams. Having been alleged as such on several occasions, it was evident that law enforcers would catch up with him,” the beautician and entrepreneur said.

Hushpuppi’s social media accounts presented him as a filthy rich real estate developer, with choppers and super cars.

He was nabbed alongside 11 others through the help of Dubai Police.

During the raid, the police seized nearly Sh4.3 billion, 13 luxury cars worth Sh720 million and phone and computer data containing more than 100,000 alleged fraud files and the addresses of nearly two million possible victims.

The arrest was triggered by report filed by a complainant who said that Hushpuppi and an unnamed person conspired to launder a Sh1.6 billion stash as well as an attempt to steal Sh13.1 billion from an unnamed English Premier League football club.

Opulent lifestyle

Prosecutors allege that Hushpuppi is a mastermind of a global network that uses computer intrusions, business email compromise (BEC) schemes and money-laundering capers to steal hundreds of millions of dollars.

According to a US federal court affidavit, one of the alleged victims was the client of a New York-based law firm that lost nearly a million dollars in 2019.

“This case targets a key player in a large, transnational conspiracy who was living an opulent lifestyle in another country while allegedly providing safe havens for stolen money around the world.

Matee, a former police officer, joined Muema Brothers in 1973 before co-founding AP Utawala band.

The artiste was accorded Head of State Commendation last year, and his initial musical themes bore a semblance to the Everly Brothers who long in the 50’s sang Take a Message to Mary which had a similar theme to Stella.

The two songs are philosophical in nature; provoking discussion on whether prisoners considered outcasts in society have a right to love and be loved back in return.

Matee’s melancholic song narrates a sad story of a man in love who is locked up in prison. He cannot meet his lover and thus sends his relatives home asking them to deliver the discouraging message to his woman.

Frontier lad

“Kamweleze nimefungwa jela dada, anizalie mtoto kike mama nitaoa (Tell her I am imprisoned sister, ask her to bear a girl for me to marry),” sings Matee.

In a recent video, Matee sets his song in a prison facility detached from the rest of the community. He leans on metallic bars as he pours his tribulations to imagined relatives visiting him.

It is a grey area of uncertainty that the creative industry uses to demonstrate subtle nature of humanity: not all those behind bars are guilty of crimes they have been accused of but they cannot change their circumstances.

Matee seems conscious of this as he does not tell the audience why he is behind bars, leaving them unaware the crime he could have committed or whether he is blackmailed. Whatever the reason, Matee demonstrates that it does not matter as he pleads for the message to be delivered to his lover Stella, for he cares for her.

The near replica to Everly Brothers’ prison version Take a Message to Mary takes a similar yet different twist, even a denial. The lover, a frontier lad asks his listeners not to disclose to his lover that he is in jail or that he turned bad by engaging in some gun drama.

“You can tell her I had to see the world or tell her that my ship set sail, you can say she’d better not wait for me but don’t tell her I’m in jail,” the American Rock and Roll band sings.

The two songs are as old as time but they still thrill audiences.

Last week on Wednesday, KBC Sundowner show host Catherine Ndonye played the song during the programme as she joined fans in mourning the star.

“The songs by Matee and Everly Brothers have one thing in common: It shows similarities in what people handed jail sentences suffer, especially, when it is about matters of the heart. Everywhere you go, I think life is the same and people are the same,” Ndonye told Saturday Standard.

Larry Wambua, Ndonye’s colleague and a longtime friend to the deceased artiste, also did a tribute on Saturday at KBC’s Radio Taifa alongside broadcaster Ali Salim Mmanga during the programme Ulimwengu wa Wanamuziki produced by John Obong’o Junior.

“I knew Matee in the early 1980s when the group used to perform in Ngara and Eastleigh.

“Matee was one Kenya’s refined musicians, humble and outstanding. It is so sad to lose one of the greatest names in Kenya’s music industry,” Wambua said.

It is not only Stella that is popular with Matee as the musician has other songs in Kikamba and Kiswahili, mostly recorded under Orchestra Muema Brothers label.

In Kilumi, Muema Brothers unveiled their full line-up starting with Kasina Muema (tumba), Sila Muema (drums); Mbili Mwendwa (trumpets), Nzau Muema (bass), Musee wa Munyao (vocals), Kanga Muema (Solo), Matee (lead vocals) and Mwania Muema (rhythm).

Some of their hit songs included Nenda Salama, Rhumba ya Matee, Purity, Jedidah, Francisca, Betty, Florence and Mwaitu Wakwa.

Artistic journey

Before his demise, this writer was set to interview him on his artistic journey and his view on police brutality was among the issues he was expected to speak about.

Matee, a former police officer, also sang Kazi ya Askari, where he defended the role of the police as the lead protectors of the people.

In the song, he bemoans the bad name the police have been given over the years as brutes despite the good services they gave.

The song coincided with the several incidences of police brutality in Kenya, which intensified during the enforcement of curfew rules after the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic.

Matee was educated in Kaloleni in Nairobi, Ithookwe in Kitui, Kitui School and later Aquinas School in Nairobi. According to his ex-band mate Musee Munyao, he died of diabetes-related complications.

West was slammed on social media for touting his family’s wealth in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic that has seen more than 36 million Americans lose their jobs.

Hours later, he released the emotional single and video “Wash Us in the Blood,” that blended references to religion and systemic racism in the United States with imagery from recent protests about deaths of Black people at the hands of police.

Some critics called the release, featuring Travis Scott, West’s best music in years.

News of his death opened the jar into his untold problems that saw him drop from mainstream limelight, his big talent dimming from the thousands of Kenyans he used to entertain on TV.

However, at a time when he was expected to get to the top, things got twisted. He stopped appearing on the show and disappeared from the public only to make his return a year later through a comedy show that aired on KBC.

The show did not last long and although Kasee got a lifeline to rejoin Churchill Live, he was no longer the consistent upbeat star he used to be.

The rivalry between the Obama siblings seems to be widening. Malik Obama is now accusing his brother, the former US President Barrack Obama of being fake.

Through social media, the eldest Obama has posted a birth certificate alleging it belongs to the former president.

According to the birth certificate, Barrack was born in Kenya in 1961 at the Coast General hospital in Mombasa, an allegation that would make the 44th POTUS ineligible for that seat.

As per Section 1 of Article Two of the United States Constitution, for one to be eligible to run for the presidential seat of the United States, one must be a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, be above age of thirty five years and been resident within the United States for fourteen Years.

In 2011, Donald J. Trump began to question President Obama’s birthplace aloud in television interviews bringing a rise to the term “Bitherism” but five years later he put a rest to the conspiracy and finally accepted that Barrack was born in the US.

According to The Atlantic an American publisher, “bitherism” is the baseless belief that the 44th president of the United States was born abroad and was therefore ineligible for the presidency and also was a secret Muslim planning to undermine America from within.

The matter surfaced in the 2008 Democratic primary that was allegedly circulated by frustrated Hillary Clinton supporters.

The same year, Orly Taitz, a Moldovan-American political conspiracy theorist, released a purported Kenyan birth certificate which she said belonged to Barrack but was later fact checked and found to be fake.

A decade later, Malik Obama has now resurfaced with another birth certificate and one of his reasons is Barrack did not support him.

“We loved him with all our hearts but he turned his back on us and poured humiliation upon humiliation on us… When he had nothing and came to Kenya we welcomed him with open arms and shared with him...”

But his sister Auma Obama, has clapped back and now wants the eldest brother to get his act together.

“So blindly consumed by #jealousy and #bitterness that you will go to any length to slander your younger brother’s name - literally! Just because he has outshone you in EVERY SINGLE ASPECT of his life. Seek relevance elsewhere big brother!”

She further added; “Long before he even knew he would be president my little brother visited his fatherland and was embraced by all!!! Malik you took center stage in welcoming him!!!”

According to the scanned live birth certificate that was released by Barracks’ presidential campaign team to counter the “bitherism” theorists, it states that he was born on August 4, in Honolulu, Hawaii at 7:24pm to an American mother of European descent and an African father.

The fierce battle has attracted the embattled former presidential hopeful Miguna Miguna who now wants Malik to let his brother be.

His loss is a big blow to the once popular locally-based Congolese band that took local airwaves by storm with their evergreen compositions that saw them become the talk of town. The artiste was a fan favourite locally and internationally.

Despite his immense talent, the late Dodo Doris preferred to keep a low profile. At some point, he quit Super Mazembe to work with Chakatumba band based in Mlolongo.

Despite performing behind the scenes, Dodo Doris will be remembered for his unique flair when it comes to handling drums, something he did with passion.

His death is a big blow to Super Mazembe, with only one person left of the 10-member band. All of them are buried at the Langata Cemetery.

Plans of his burial, also at the Langata Cemetery are being made. There are about 60 other Congolese musicians who are buried there.",Arts/Culture/Celebrities,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

She bubbled with excitement as she awaited approval from the group administrator of the online entertainment group 254 Diaspora Deejays.

Her siblings and friends, monitoring the progress of the fans tuning in, cheered her on as the numbers on the Instagram live show steadily swelled.

As she got her cue to start, and just as anxious as her fans, she said 'twende sasa,' (let's get started).

Her hands were up in the air and her feet on the equipment.

A little jerk… then she controls her balance on her seat towering over the deejaying equipment placed on the ground.

One foot was on her laptop. The other on the decks. With her toe, she pressed play and the internet went on overdrive.

This is not your ordinary deejay. And this was not an ordinary show either.

Diagnosed with cerebral palsy at a tender age, Winfred Wanjiku aka DJ Wiwa, became an online sensation when her deejaying skills impressed thousands.

""To date, people are still looking down on me because of my condition.

""Cerebral palsy has been a major hindrance to my growth as a deejay. I do not get gigs yet everyone agrees that I am talented and competent.

""They often ask how I can be a deejay yet my upper body is unstable,” she says.

Born and raised in Kirinyaga County, the 26-year-old DJ Wiwa only took to the decks two years ago after making up her mind to try what has been her passion since childhood.

Her mother promised to see to it that she achieved her goals. And her friends did their bit by encouraging her as they had seen that she could make it.

“My mum was my number one fan but she died last year on Christmas Day. That was heartbreaking. I don’t think I have got over it. Now, my biggest fans are my siblings and my closest friends,"" she says.

She starts her live set with deejays’ sound effects of 'mo fire' before skillfully turning up the volume as Sol Generations ""Extravaganza"" starts playing.

Her friends, recording her live session on camera, cheer her on.

She grooves to the jam with a smile of satisfaction. Kenyans are finding a new star in her.

""So many people tried to discourage me saying I can't operate the turntables.

""Others said deejays are immoral people but there's nothing that gives me so much joy than proving them wrong and playing an entertaining set,"" she says.

Wiwa holds a Diploma in Tourism and Business Studies but says every door that she knocked on after college was shut in her face.

""Many would question how I will work and talk to customers with such a slurred speech. I eventually started hawking jewellery with my mother in Kirinyaga.

""After some time, she said she felt we had raised enough money for a deejaying course. I was shocked at her proposal, but I took it up since really I love music,"" she says.

Within minutes into her set, thousands had logged in with numerous others sharing on the web and pledging to support her.

""The Diaspora account is a very interactive platform. I have since gained hundreds of fans, from across the globe, who are reaching out to help while others have requested for another session, which will be soon.

""Hopefully, when the pandemic ends, I could be flying out for gigs. It's been a blessing in disguise,” she says.

Does the deejaying fraternity in Kenya know about her and how have they supported her?

""Kenyan deejays are my fans and I also look up to them. As a matter of fact, the deejaying community gifted me my decks. It will be an honour to play alongside them,"" she says.

By the end of her live set, she set a record number of views that most deejays could only wish for. Over 2,000 comments wishing her the best in her deejaying career was a great motivation to her.

""I've never felt so much love. I plan to work harder in getting corporate shows and broaden my fan base. I'd also love to play on a TV or radio station should I be given a chance. My ultimate goal is to be an international deejay. All things are possible,” she says and adds: ""Many people discouraged me but I never let it hinder my dream. I encourage everyone to pursue their dreams no matter what and I believe in doing what I love even with what people see as a limitation.""",Arts/Culture/Celebrities,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

The two concerts dubbed Double Bill are part of a series of events that have been lined up for artistes by Trace East Africa in conjunction with Safaricom, DStv and Showmax.

While Khaligraph was lined up to thrill thousands of his online followers last night, the other one, a gospel show, will go live tomorrow night and will be streamed live on several online channels.

What is more refreshing about tomorrow’s gig is that the two gospel artistes will be launching their new songs during the live concerts that will be transmitted from Protel Studios in Nairobi. A back-up band and a few fans will spice up the show.

“Catch me live on YouTube tonight. For every post I am putting up today, I am giving away airtime so long as you tell me why you deserve it,” Khaligraph posted on Instagram yesterday.

“We just released Worthy, a praise song by Eunice and Evelyn. The song is truly inspiring and spiritually nourishing.

""They haven’t performed it anywhere as yet. It will be exciting having them share the stage on Sunday,” said Agundabweni Akweyu of Bwenieve, the song's producer.

The artistes and event organisers are banking on the current demand for fresh entertainment from music fans at a time when most entertainment spots are closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Unlike the ordinary concerts, the online ones attract many people too.

The concerts have also given Kenyans who do not ordinarily attend events the opportunity to enjoy. This new move has forced artistes and other entertainment business structures to rebrand as they redirect their audiences to follow them on social media platforms.

It has also forced social media platforms to restructure some of their apps, including Facebook that has introduced an option for people to charge for access to events with Facebook Live streams.

“The live concert series opens up a social media platform for artistes to perform live in front of loving fans from all over the world.

""They also ensure Kenyan artistes continue to earn during this pandemic that has seen many lose their source of livelihood owing to the ban on public gatherings,” says Danny Mucira, Trace Eastern Africa managing director.

“Artistes and the entertainment industry have had a change in business strategies. It is no longer about the huge concerts we used to have. Everyone is changing their showbiz model to tap into the online numbers. This is where the money is,” says Shaffie Weru, who has been running a show on Instagram featuring artistes from across the continent.

In this new normal, corporate firms and other stakeholders in the entertainment industry are now battling to sponsor online projects by popular artistes who are also being used to push brand visibility for such organisations.

From food and alcohol brands to phone and other tech companies, celebrities are taking advantage of the online space to advertising for brands.

Some artistes are enjoying the windfall as this trend is getting them double the amounts they would have earned from offline projects.

Zimbabwean film Cook Off, a romance about a struggling single mother who finds love during a cooking competition, premiered on Netflix on Monday, a debut that its makers hope will propel the country’s small film sector to global audiences.

Zimbabwe often grabs headlines for its economic woes and political crises, but producer Joe Njagu said the film sought to project a different image.

“I wanted the world to know that there is more to Zimbabwe than what they hear. We also fall in love, we also enjoy nice food. We also have very nice stories,” said Njagu.

With a production budget of only $8,000, Njagu said he used his personal relationships with the cast and crew to sign deferred contracts and to bring on board studio owners and equipment hire companies without making immediate payment.

The low budget film was shot in 2017 but very few people in Zimbabwe had heard of it, even after it won several awards at international film festivals, including in the Netherlands, Durban and United States.

Everything changed two and half months ago, when Netflix, the world’s leading entertainment streaming service with 189 million paid viewers, came knocking on the door.

“It’s a big ‘hello, this is Zimbabwe we are here’. It’s an opportunity for us to introduce our content to the rest of the world. It’s really a big deal for us,” Njagu said.

He would not say how much the Netflix deal was worth but that it was enough to pay the deferred expenses and make a profit.

The film creators are now in talks with Netflix about possible future productions while television stations in Europe, Africa, United States also want to air Cook Off.

“It’s a different story, it’s no longer deferred payments, it’s now commissioned work, it’s now getting budgets to do productions,” he said.

Nzenze died at Mukumu Mission Hospital at about 2pm, where he had been hospitalised for a month, battling hypertension and stomach ulcers.

The 80-year-old was best known for his Angelike Twist hit song released in the early 1960s.

His younger sister Mary Mwanga said Mr Amutabi was operated on four weeks ago on his prostrate, and was recuperating well before his situation deteriorated on Friday leading to his death on Saturday.

“He has been having stomach ulcers that have disturbed his health for quite some while. When we eventually took him to hospital, it was found that he had other problems with his prostate that called for an operation,” Ms Mwanga said.

His first cousin Paul Ingatia said since moving from Nairobi and settling in the village, Amutabi has had challenges financially, which contributed to further deterioration of his health.

“He was completely forgotten after moving to the village. While in Nairobi, he could perform in some clubs and get his daily bread, but as his age advanced, he could no longer perform,” Mr Ingatia said.

He urged the government to hasten and pay the family some royalties that were announced by President Uhuru Kenyatta so they can clear his hospital bills and give him a befitting send off for a hero.

Nzenze retired from active music in 2016 and had been living at his home since then, leading a quiet lifestyle.

His other hit songs included Marashi ya Warembo, Maoni ya Twist, Kumbuka Nyumbani and Wanawake Kuwakimbia Mabwana.

Area leaders have eulogised Nzenze as one of the pioneers of music among his Tiriki sub tribe, noting he had been a living hero who did not struggle for fame.

“Despite Nzenze producing hit songs well before most of us were born, we have lived listening to his songs for many years.

Freemake Audio Converter

As far as software file converters go, few are as popular as Freemake Audio Converter. It is user-friendly, and supports over 50 audio formats. On top of that, it will let you add videos and extract the audio from them too.

The features in Freemake Audio Converter cover most of the basics and will let you add files in batches, upload to Google Drive or Dropbox, adjust the audio settings, and merge audio files together. However the free version does have a big limitation and can only convert audio files that are 3 minutes long at most.

Zamzar

Over the years Zamzar has made a name for itself as one of the more popular and long-standing online file converters. It can not only convert audio files, but also documents, videos, and images. In total it supports over a thousand formats too.

Zamzar will let you choose to either upload files or copy videos from an online link. While there are some restrictions in terms of the maximum file size, it is nothing too heavy-handed and you may not even notice it if you just use the service casually.

MediaHuman Audio Converter

If what you’re after is a software that is simple, straightforward and easy to use – MediaHuman Audio Converter will fit the bill perfectly. It is a lean audio converter that has very few frills, and yet supports most audio formats.

The one area where the MediaHuman Audio Converter does fall short is that you won’t be able to adjust the audio settings that freely with this software.

VSDC Free Audio Converter

VSDC Free Audio Converter is a software with a relatively simple tabbed interface. It supports most of the common audio and video formats, and you can choose to browse for files or enter the online URL.

While it does not have editing features, VSDC Free Audio Converter will give you a great degree of freedom to adjust the audio settings. The only irritation when using it may be the fact that the setup tends to install various other programs and toolbars that you probably don’t want or need.

123Apps Online Audio Converter

The 123Apps Online Audio Converter is one of the more nifty tools if you just want to convert audio files. It does not support any other types of files aside from them, so you can’t extract the audio from videos.

However, the one thing that stands out about this online converter however is its additional options. Aside from adjusting the quality and audio settings, it will also let you edit the track info.

DVDSoft Free Audio Converter

DVDSoft Free Audio Converter a simple software with a light interface. It is easy to use, supports most audio formats, and can convert files in batches. While it does let you adjust the audio settings, it may not have the advanced options that are present in some other converters.

When you convert audio files with this app you’ll be able to adjust the audio settings quite freely. Aside from uploading or downloading files, AConvert has both Google Drive and Dropbox integration.

Pazera Free Audio Extractor

As its name suggests, Pazera Free Audio Extractor is designed to not just convert audio files, but extract them from videos. It does support most of the popular audio formats, however, which makes it a good converter.

Aside from converting audio files, Pazera Free Audio Extractor will let you split them and adjust their settings. Its interface can be a bit clunky, however, especially for first-time users.

FileZigZag

FileZigZag is yet another multi-purpose online file converter that supports many different types of files. In terms of audio formats it supports 29 of them – which should be enough for casual file conversions.

The limitations in FileZigZag aren’t that bad, and users with a free account can convert files up to 180MB. The drawback however is that the files you convert will be sent via email – which is often slow and not ideal.

Final Word

See how each of the audio converters in the top 10 brings something unique to the table? If you’re finding it hard to choose between them, our recommendation is that you start by giving Online UniConverter a try – especially if you’re looking for a quick and convenient way to convert audio files.",Arts/Culture/Celebrities,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

State Department for Culture and Heritage Principal Secretary (PS) Josephta Mukobe announced that an online portal had been set up to facilitate sending of proposals.

The programme, the PS said, will be implemented by the relevant departments and agencies who will also be responsible for disbursement of funds.

“We are cognisant of the fact that Kenya has over 100,000 creatives and that the available funding may not be sufficient to cover all artistes engaged within the creative economy. Therefore, this will be a competitive process,” Mukobe said in a statement.

Sports ministry earlier this month launched the stimulus package in line with the order issued by President Uhuru Kenyatta on April 6, 2020, directing the Sports, Arts and Social Development Fund to avail Sh100 million to cushion those in the creative industry during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Artistes from different creative sectors will therefore be required to produce works that entertain and educate Kenyans and the world on the safety and health precautions to stop the spread of Covid-19.

The Permanent Presidential Music Commission (PPMC) will facilitate the participation of musicians, DJs, dancers and Acapella groups in all their categories.

Department of Culture will cover comedians and visual artists, Kenya Cultural Centre will be responsible for actors, poets, story-tellers, theatre, including radio theatre and mimes, the National Museums of Kenya will oversee mural and graffiti artists while the Kenya Film Commission will manage all matters film and content creation.

Interested practitioners can now visit the portal and fill in the provided application forms for consideration. The criteria is spelt out on the website under the various genres.

It is estimated that the programme will directly benefit over 20,000 musicians, actors and artists from all the 47 counties and over 80,000 additional people from the beneficiaries’ households, 30 per cent of whom are vulnerable groups and persons living with disabilities.

“The ministry shall endeavour to guarantee participation in all the 47 counties, ensure gender parity and pay particular emphasis on the 30 per cent reservation for vulnerable groups, including Persons Living with Disability,” said Mukobe.

She assured the industry practitioners and the general public that the selection process will be fair, transparent and accountable.

Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed noted during the launch that the Sh100 million was not a reservoir of free funds, but a provision to educate, innovate, sustain and improve the sector’s output.

The project is set to supplement government’s efforts in combating Covid-19 and its effects by engaging and mobilising the cultural and creative artistes in strategic messaging on behaviour change to flatten the coronavirus transmission curve including, but not limited to social distancing, hand washing and wearing personal protective equipment such as masks.

Lingala music fans are still reeling in shock following the demise of popular locally based Congolese musician Kasongo wa Kanema, the third leader of Super Mazembe band.

Despite his immense talent, popularity and ability to capture hundreds of fans locally and abroad, not to mention the hit 'Kasongo' that became a favourite with various local airwaves and night clubs, in death, Kasongo was buried with little fanfare at Lang'ata cemetery in Nairobi.

He becomes the latest Congolese musician to be buried at the Nairobi cemetery, alongside more than 50 locally based Congolese musicians who came to Kenya and found a place to call home. Eternally.

Kasongo was in the process of recording his debut solo album yet to be named. He had plans of selling it over the internet.

Kasongo believed the album, done in Lingala with a tinge of French and Swahili, would be an instant hit.

A popular music producer who recorded a number of locally based Congolese musicians, other Congolese musicians based in DRC and many Lingala music fans agree that in life, Kasongo was a force to reckon with going by his immense achievements.

The third band leader of Super Mazembe after the late Longwa Dodos (founder of Super Mazembe and the first bandleader followed by the late Atis Ajos), Kasongo ensured he kept the band going despite the health challenge he faced.

Just like his fellow Congolese musicians, Kasongo came, sang and found eternal home at Langata.

The first to take the transition was Baba Gasto, founder of Baba National band, who died in March 25, 1997, having quite music to concentrate on business. He is well remembered for a number of his composition like Kakolele and Viva Christmas. He moved to Nairobi from Tanzanian in 1975 with band.

He was among the first Congolese musicians to be buried at Langata.

Since then, the number of Congolese musicians buried at Langata has increased. They include Mazembe Longwa Dodos credited with most compositions in the band among them Shauri Yako, Loboko Longwa, Samba, Jiji, mobange, Namibalikale and Gina.

Also buried at Langata is Lovi Longomba, the son of Vicky Longomba who was an associate of the great Franco Luambo Luanzo in 1960s. He was the half brother of techno soukous Awilo Longomba.

Others include base guitarist Ati Djo famed for keeping the original orchestra super Mazembe dance beat. He was among Congolese musicians who moved to Kenya in 1970s from Zaire (DRC) in search of greener pasture alongside Alley Kaylee Kilambey.

One cannot forget Moreno Batamba, band leader of orchestre Moja One, a household name in Kenya back in the days. He is remembered for several hit songs among them Naimba Tuwachane, Dunia ni Duara, Kanzele, Fini, Dunia sio yako wala sio tangu, Kadogo, Kalume, Tafuta and Sikutaki.

Another is Mose Fan Fan who died sometime last year but was among the few Congolese musicians privileged to be buried in the UK, having obtaining citizenship.

High cost

According to Fisecoze, a member of locally based Congolese band Rumba Japan and a scion of the late Papa Wemba, it costs about $US700 to transport a body to DRC by flight, which is quite expensive, hence opting to bury their dead at Langata.

""It does not cost much to get a permit to bury the dead at Langata,"" adds band leader Longwa Ngoi, son of the late Longwa Dodos.

Kenyan Lingala dancer Caroline Akinyi from Nyanza says her Congolese Kenyan based husband Evala, whom she met in Nairobi while still a student, was buried at Langata.

Other Congolese musicians buried at Langata include drumist Kaskas Majela who worked with a number of locally based musicians among them Kanda King and his band. Others include base guitarist Masella and dancer GauGau.

According to Mr Nderitu Maina, who has been in charge of the cemetery since 2008, temporary permits issued for cheaper graves do not allow for ceremonial burials.

""I can say the situation has not improved. Often we have had to exhume bodies to create space for fresh ones. You simply bury and go,"" he said, referring to most of the foreigners (Congolese) unable to afford permanent areas to bury their loved ones.

“In these uncertain times, the role of entertainment in enriching lives is more significant than ever. People are looking for ways to connect with their passions and this can now best be done by plugging into our strong online networks.

This partnership with Trace TV, who we also carry on our platform, is a great opportunity for us to ensure we are serving fresh content that resonates with our customers despite the existent challenges,” MultiChoice Kenya Managing Director Nancy Matimu, said.

The online shows are of an interactive nature where viewers can get involved by making song requests and enrolling in competitions where winners get giveaways.

While ordinary concerts attract around 2,000 fans, the live online platforms are offering both artistes and sponsors more leverage with thousands of fans and followers who would not make it to an ordinary gig streaming. This hands the artistes a bigger bargaining power when it comes to payments.

Although the show sponsors are mum about the amount of money they are paying the artistes, The Standard has learnt that the rates are almost the same as those paid during nationwide concerts. Calibre artistes take home about Sh150,000 during a big corporate show.

“We can’t disclose the amount the organisers and sponsors are paying because of contractual agreements. What one has to understand is that these shows are commanding big numbers than ordinary concerts due to how they are being organised.

“We want to put as much money as we can in our musicians’ pockets to keep their careers moving during this rough patch,” said a Trace Live event organiser who sought anonymity.

The big winners in these new online shows are artistes who have a big online following. King Kaka for instance has 1.1 million followers on Instagram while Mercy Masika has slightly over 800 thousand followers.

“Musicians survive from gig to gig. That is their lifestyle and that is how they make their income. Online gigs and other interactive activities like the Shaffie Live show will ensure that sponsors and advertisers turn their big spending on artistes online.

“This is already happening and is reshaping our entertainment industry,” says Shaffie Weru, an emcee who has been hosting artistes on his online show.

While deejays among them Crème de la Crème, DJ Mfalme and the Dohty Family stable have been hosting weekly online shows, some of which have been sponsored by liquor companies, local comedians seem to be a step ahead. Singer Akothee, who has almost two million followers on Instagram, is an online ambassador for a local food processing firm.

This month, the bi-monthly Koroga entertainment and social event hosted fans to an online concert that was headlined by South Africa’s Distruction Boyz.

Live streaming

The show that was livestreamed on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram commanded quite a following, registering over 3,000 viewers. The show attracted viewership from East Africa as well as southern Africa.

Local entertainment creatives are yet to receive the promised Sh100 million as the ministry struggles to come up with an all-inclusive list.

Early last month, President Uhuru Kenyatta directed the Ministry of Sports, Culture and Heritage to help artistes, actors and musicians sustain themselves as they continue entertaining the public through TV, radio and the internet during the period of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Yesterday, the creatives umbrella organisations – Music Copyright Society of Kenya (MCSK), Kenya Association of Music Producers (Kamp) and Performance Rights Society of Kenya (PRiSK) – issued a joint communication exonerating themselves from allegations that the funds had been forwarded to them.

They claimed that even after making a follow-up with the Ministry of Sports, Culture and Heritage, they are yet to get any feedback regarding the matter.

“On April 6, President Uhuru Kenyatta in his Address to the Nation and update on the coronavirus pandemic directed the ministry to avail (sic) Sh100 million from the Sports Fund to help cushion creatives from the economic impact of the pandemic. Since the pronouncement, we have noted that there are speculations, confusion and mixed reactions among creatives as well as the public on various media platforms regarding these funds,” the statement read.

“Jointly, we wrote a letter to the Ministry of Sports, Culture and Heritage on April 20 to make follow up on the funds. As of today, we have not received any feedback,” it went on.

“What I know for a fact is that the ministry should come up with a mode and criteria of disbursing the funds. Besides the creatives who are members of the three Collective Management Organisations (CMOs), other artistes such as actors are also made to benefit from the funds and coming up with a criteria or concrete data on this might take ministry time. I think artistes should be a bit patient,” said Edward Sigei, who is the CEO of Kenya Copyright Board, the government arm under which the CMOs are housed.

The wait continues

We reached out to the department of culture in the ministry on phone for comment, but we were informed that the director was not in and no other official could comment on the issue.

The wait continues as individual organisations in the hard-hit entertainment sector work on modalities of cushioning artistes from Covid-19 pandemic economic pinch.

A few weeks ago, MCSK distributed Sh34 million to artistes as royalties, with PRiSK paying out Sh14.7 million to its members.

“The entertainment industry is hard-hit and to mitigate the situation for our members, we are doing everything possible to ensure that their dues are paid,” said Japheth Kassanga, the MCSK chairman who is also a veteran gospel singer and music producer and director.

Local filmmakers have not been left entirely in the cold with the Kenya Film Commission (KFC) giving about Sh25 million in a project set to help them.

The empowerment programme announced last week will provide film and video-related funding in the broad categories of education and training.

KFC is also running a mobile phone film competition themed Covid-19 – Staying at Home and Social Distancing in which the winner will take home Sh200,000, with the first and second runners up pocketing Sh150,000 and Sh100,000 respectively.

“The industry needs money and if we can get funding to help grow the industry, that means we can exploit many opportunities. We are exploiting every opportunity and taking every challenge head-on as we engage around the situation of Covid-19,” Timothy Owase, the KFC CEO, said.

Most film and music production firms in Kenya have halted their planned productions following the Covid-19 pandemic.

“The entertainment sector has obviously been affected by the prevailing circumstances, not just in Kenya but globally. Most projects have been put off as it is not ideal to do major shoots,” said actress and film producer Maureen Koech, popularly known for her role in Lies that Bind, that used to air on KTN.

Her Relic House Production comedy series Age of Grace had been scheduled to premiere this month but this has been pushed forward.

According to Phil Bresson, a director at Insignia Productions, which has been doing many productions for local TV stations such as Changing Times and My Two Wives that aired on KTN as well as Socialites, the pandemic has brought the film industry to a halt.

Talents at risk

“An ordinary film shoot scene has a minimum of 25 people. That’s more than a crowd already, according to the regulations given on social distancing.

""This rule can’t even apply in a recording because a cameraman has to be very close to the subject,” said Bresson, who together with Grace Kahaki, run the production house. “Insignia has stopped shooting programmes that it had running on local channels.""

He added that the company can’t put film talents at risk.

Besides productions getting halted, movie halls have shut down. Movie distributors like Century Cinemax and Fox Theatres who control the theatre space in major towns in Kenya are counting loses.

Some of the biggest movie releases that were expected out such as Warner Bros' The Batman and In the Heights have been cancelled.

The Many Saints of Newark, a prequel to The Sopranos, which was to be out in September, has been pushed to March next year.

Some other leading international movie firms such as Disney, Universal and Grimmfest have opted to release some of their productions through streaming platforms.",Arts/Culture/Celebrities,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

“..I studied very hard, and you know what I ended up being? A musician, just a simple musician. My original mentality is of a scientist. Music was my third test subject, after chemistry and literature”.

This poignant statement is a quote, uttered by globally acclaimed artiste, the late Ayub Ogada, interviewed by Banning Eyre, writer/producer of American Afropop Worldwide radio show.

Hailed as Kenya’s international music export, Ogada was ‘discovered’ busking in the UK, at an underground subway. He loved to strum a ‘primitive’ instrument, the eight-string nyatiti Luo harp commonly known as kamba nane.

This was thousands of miles away from home – perhaps a damning indictment of decades-long, lingering lack of talent nurturing facilities and music-career development structures.

Earlier this week, President Uhuru Kenyatta’s announced a government-backed increase for local artistes’ royalty earnings to Sh200 million per month – an annual Sh2 billion payout. Is there any chance this move could even remotely turn around the stakes?

The speech sparked off widespread debate and a state of palpable confusion. The uncertainty hinges on lack of clearly spelt out criteria or modalities for funds distribution.

Fears are rampant, only ‘visible’, known and digital-savvy musicians – riding on digital platforms popularity, could reap from government’s windfall.

A well-connected industry player-cum artiste, who requested anonymity, opines top Ministry of Sports, Culture and Heritage officials, learnt of latest presidential directive after State House presser.

“We all publicly applauded President’s gesture, but I’m sure no one wants to contradict the good news, a scenario generations of music makers have fought for – decent earnings from our art. On the ground, implications of this announcement had not been anticipated,” he remarks.

Undisputedly, for most musicians of immediate concern – is the complexity of such a directive with no laid out, definitive structures.

Intellectual property rights, copyrights and royalties’ facets are so intricate and multi-layered. Most creatives crave to focus on their passion – be creative and making their art, be it on canvas, music, theatre or films.

Bottom-line is monetizing an array of artistic expressions. In terms of sustainable livelihood earnings from music, Ogada is an ideal case study.

He may not have been prolific composer or recording artiste – credited with just five albums in a career spanning half-century.

He tried to make headway locally, but his debut 10-track solo album En Mana Kuoyo (Just Sand) – a classic blend of deeply resonant Luo traditional music with contemporary pop elements – propelled him to global acclaim.

Recorded on UK’s Real World Records label, songs like Ondiek and Obiero are soundtracks in the film I Dreamed of Africa starring Kim Bassinger.

He struck gold after its inclusion in box-office, feature films notably Fernando Meirelles’ adaptation of John Le Carré’s book The Constant Gardener (2005),The Good Lie (2014) and popular Guinness Greatness TV campaign commercial advert launched across Africa in 2007.

Other commissions include composing scores for movie Samsara (2011). The tracks Running to Village and Coming Home stand out on South African adventure-drama film Duma directed by Carroll Ballard.

Success, earned from elusive royalties at home, swamped his career overseas. Curiously, a song he recorded few years before switch to UK – is aptly, titled Problems.

“… everybody knows you got problems.. that’s the way it goes../ you hustling up n down.. it’s gonna drive you crazy.. / no one seems to care.. what you do or say.. / walking through the streets.. with hunger in my soul..” he sings.

In light of President Kenyatta’s directive, underneath the enthusiasm, lies conspicuous fact that a chain of creatives are entitled to royalties.

“There are four main royalties – mechanical, synchronisation, print music and public performance. A functional industry relies on these as primary source of payment for musicians,” says keyboardist Jared Ashuma.

Standard practice in the West entails royalties split for composers, recording artistes, background vocalists (BGVs), instrumentalists, publishers and other copyright holders.

“But for years in Kenya, only composers and producers benefit from royalties – a skewed and raw deal for many behind-scenes-musicians,” remarks Ashuma, a visually impaired, skillful keyboardist never registered under MCSK or any musicians’ organiaation.

“I performed with Black Tango and Ibeba Systems bands in 1990s. I could not join MCSK then, membership was restricted to composers, with songs on sale in the market,” he recalls.

Ashuma is adamant any government initiatives must address collective welfare of all musicians – as many remain victims of existing loopholes linked to inadequate industry structures.

Composers-cum-singers Beverly Kadzo and Mary Hamboga aka Almaz are registered MCSK members, but are yet to receive any dues.

“For registration, I submitted songs I struggled to record. I’m now hopeful the Presidential directive bears fruits to enable beginners develop fledgling music careers,” she says.

Kadzo concurs that any government programmes must empower broader creatives’ sector with appropriate modalities spelt out to reap long-term benefits.

For Almaz, who fronts Latapaza band, she’s also Performers Rights Society of Kenya (PRISK) member.

“The highest amount I’ve received is Sh3,000 – MCSK amounts are lesser – which is demoralising,” she notes.

Determine royalties

Almaz singles out lack of real-time radio or television songs airplay logs – a tracking system purportedly used to determine royalties owed to registered CMOs members.

“The local Collective Management Organisations compile top-earning artistes list. But the burning question is, who exactly monitors songs played – on TV, radio, in matatus or other public broadcast licensed places?” she poses.

In the venues she performs, all CMOs collect annual fees plus taxes from licences issued to establishments. Do these revenues trickle down to live bands instrumentalists not registered by CMOs?.

Equally crucial is radio airplay – is there a deliberate, skewed foreign music dominance on local stations? A thorny factor technically implies, huge payments are wired into non-Kenyan musicians’ offshore accounts.

There are concerns regarding local music quality. But bigger question is: have setbacks that impact supposed ‘sub-standard’ home-grown productions been addressed effectively?

Making of good music requires professional, top-notch recording studio, sound engineering, song-mixing and mastering facilities. Are these skill-sets available locally? What key incentives, import duty or shipping taxations waivers has the government offered?

President Uhuru Kenyatta has lauded the county government of Nakuru for coming to the rescue of the business community by waiving various taxes on their investments amid tough economic times.

Uhuru, who was addressing the media at State House, lauded Governor Lee Kinyanjui over the move saying it will go a long way in giving a reprieve to the business community.

“I am glad that Nakuru has announced reduced taxes for its people. That is their way of helping the businesses remain afloat. We hope that other counties under lockdown will follow suit,” said Uhuru.

Kinyanjui had on Thursday announced a raft of measures touching on the reduction of various taxes and fees payable to the county government by investors under different categories within the county.

“Pursuant to provision of Nakuru County Finance Act, 2019 and the Public Finance Management Act 2012, the county government of Nakuru through the approval of the governor has granted various sectors their respective tax incentives,” read a statement from the county government.

Kenya’s dream of being an oil exporter appears to be slipping away after Tullow Oil wrote off billions of shillings it has spent in exploring for oil in Lokichar, Turkana County.

The company, in its annual report for the year to December 2020, said it has written off $430 million (Sh46.8 billion) in exploration costs, attributing it to low global oil prices.

Oil prices tanked at the beginning of last year to an average of $17 (Sh1,853) per barrel in April, making investors edgy about putting money in the industry.

The amount of money exploration companies recoup from their investment hinges on the price of oil in the international market, meaning currently, they are likely to take longer to recover their money.

The write-offs are in addition to a significant reduction in the activities Tullow is undertaking in the country.

The British firm has also cited major delays in the Kenya project among the key risks to its operations in the coming year.

Kenya accounted for nearly half of the exploration write-offs, which totalled $987 million (Sh106 billion).

In Uganda, the firm wrote off $451 million (Sh49 billion) last year, with the two East African countries accounting for 90 per cent of the exploration costs write-off.

“The total exploration cost write-offs for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $987 million (Sh106 billion), predominantly driven by a write-down of the value of Kenya due to a reduction in the group’s long-term accounting nominal oil price assumption from $65 (Sh7,085) per barrel to $60 (Sh6,540) per barrel and Uganda was written down to the fair value of the consideration as part of the disposal,” said Tullow in its report.

It is the second year in a row that Tullow has made a major write-off on its exploration costs in Kenya, having written off $419 million (Sh45.7 billion) in 2019.

This has seen the firm’s remaining recoverable amount drop to $247 million (Sh26.9 billion).

The company also expressed concern about delays in the Kenyan project.

Kenya will receive about Sh34.4 billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) next week as part of the 38-month loan agreement with the Washington-based institution.

In a press briefing yesterday, Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) Governor Patrick Njoroge said the IMF board was expected to approve the Sh262 billion loan agreement on Friday.

“And then, early next week, there will be the consequential disbursements. We will receive the disbursements of about $314 million over the next few days after that,” said Dr Njoroge.

Njoroge said the money was not only expected to help Kenya’s balance of payments by shoring up foreign exchange reserves but also offer budgetary support in light of the effects of Covid-19.

“The bottom line here is that the programme is intended to support Covid-19 response and…provide direct budget support,” said Njoroge. He said the programme intends to anchor debt vulnerabilities and reduce them.

Mid-February, the IMF approved Sh261 billion credit facility, which will also see the State undertake the restructuring of its ailing parastatals.

There are fears that the restructuring of the struggling State-owned enterprising will be reminiscent of the 1990s structural adjustment programme that left thousands of public servants without jobs.

However, Kenya requested some leeway to prop up corporations that have been hit hard by Covid-19, with Treasury releasing Sh26 billion to recapitalise cash-strapped Kenya Airways.

Winnie Wairimu Kiarie wants the court to take action against Kirubi Kamau for allegedly using Robert Mburu Mbugua’s signature and stamp to change particulars of directorship at Central Highlands Tea Company Limited in June 2019. Mbugua died in 2008.

Through lawyer Duncan Savwa, Wairimu claimed that it was not possible for her husband, who died 11 years ago, to sign the documents. Wairimu said the action constitutes fraud and demeans her husband, who was a lawyer of good standing.

“Since she is the legal representative of her late husband and the custodian of his documents, the businessman’s action of forging his signature has been interpreted to mean that she is part of the fraud,” said Savwa.

Kamau is listed in the court documents as the chairman of Tamarind Valley Ltd, director of Rype Limted, Rico Fries Limited, Chambers Garden Limited and Vice Chairman of Central Tea Company Limited.

Wairimu said she learnt that Kamau had used an affidavit commissioned and signed by her husband to effect changes of directorship at the tea company after some shareholders went to court to challenge the changes. Savwa told the court that the action meant to lie to the public that Wairimu’s husband was alive in June 2019 and meant to portray her as dishonest.

“The businessman presented the documents authorised by a dead lawyer to the registrar of companies while knowing that his conduct would cause harm and distress to the widow. The widow is now being viewed as a person using her late husband’s name to gain financially,” said Savwa.

NAIROBI, KENYA: The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) has announced the resumption of fees charged on mobile money platforms linked to Savings and Credit Societies(Saccos).

On Thursday notice, the regulator clarifies that the new order is specific to transactions above Sh100

CBK noted that the waiver had caused worries on the viability of the services due to the inability to cover underlying costs.

“This is a significant risk for SACCOs and their extensive membership due to the lack of other alternatives to connect to the mobile money ecosystem. The resumption of charges will provide space to increase the connection options for SACCOs,” said CBK in a statement.

CBK noted that these wallets and accounts contribute to a big share of SACCO transactions with banks bridging domestic and cross border payment systems.

The apex bank added that the resumption of the charges would be subject to review by CBK against some principles it introduced last year.

“These principles were introduced on the expiry of the emergency measures waiving charges for low-value mobile money person to person transactions below Sh1,000. Other measures on waiver of charges between mobile money wallets and bank accounts remained in force.

Local banks have two types of mobile banking wallets. These include banks partner with payment service providers to utilise their mobile money wallets to enable transactions through customers’ bank accounts and banks developing their own in-house mobile banking wallets to facilitate mobile money.

Last month the Central Bank of Kenya announced the expiry of measures on the restructuring of loans for bank borrowers.



CBK introduced the measures last year in March to cushion customers seeking relief from the effects of the coronavirus.



Among them was restructuring by banks for loans that were performing as at March 2, 2020 and the provision of regulatory flexibility to banks by CBK.



Loan borrowers whose loans were performing before March 3, 2020 but were restructured now have until June 3 (three months) to regularise their loans.

Loans worth Sh28.4 billion that were restructured have gone bad after borrowers failed to service them, recent data from the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) shows.

This means that banks might be forced to forward the names of these borrowers to Credit Reference Bureaus (CRBs) for blacklisting or recover the loans by auctioning the borrowers’ assets in case of secured loans.

This is after borrowers, whose loans were performing before March 2, 2020, but who were negatively impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic were allowed by lenders to reschedule them by six to 12 months.

However, after the end of the debt repayment holiday, these borrowers were unable to repay their loans as they had been before the pandemic, a reflection of a tough business environment that saw lots of workers in industries such as aviation and hotels and restaurants laid off.

Of the Sh1.7 trillion loans that were restructured, more than two-thirds had matured and been repaid.

Central Bank of Kenya Governor Patrick Njoroge noted that the remaining Sh569.3 billion were outstanding as of the end of February.

Out of this, said Njoroge, 95 per cent of the loans had returned to normalcy, which means that the borrowers were paying them per their terms. “Only about five per cent of these loans were not up to date with their repayments,” said Njoroge, in his post-Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) briefing to the media. “You can see that the problem here is quite contained.”

These loans fed into the growing stream of non-performing loans (NPLs), loans that have not been serviced for over three months, following the adverse effects of Covid-19.

The virus saw several businesses shut down, workers retrenched, sent on compulsory leave or their salaries reduced. NPLs as a share of total loans has risen marginally and is expected to peak at 16 per cent in the worst-case scenario, according to CBK.

By end of February, NPLs as a percentage of total loans stood at 14.5 per cent from 14.1 per cent last December. “However, adjusting for the provisions that have already been incorporated, the ratio stands at 5.8 per cent, which is manageable,” said Njoroge.

More than a week ago, the one-year holiday that had allowed borrowers to restructure came to an end, with the CBK Governor noting that they had served their purpose of cushioning firms and households.

The CBK boss noted that lenders and depositors would get hurt if the measures went on. He said continued implementation of the measures would also create a moral hazard or bad behaviour, where borrowers got too comfortable and refused to service their loans.

Days after the country announced its first case of Covid-19 on March 13, last year, CBK struck a deal with banks that allowed loans that were not in arrears, but whose borrowers were negatively affected by the pandemic, to defer payment for between six and 12 months.

CBK said the measures provided borrowers with restructuring options, including an extension of the repayment period, a standstill on payment of principal or interest and waivers on interest or fees.

“The measures have provided space to borrowers to ride through the pandemic, mitigate job losses and pivot their business models to the new normal,” explained CBK.",Business,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

The President announced new stringent measures aimed at curbing the spread of the Third Wave of Covid-19 infections, scuttling plans for many traders and investors.

Unfortunately, unlike last year, the additional stringent measures were not accompanied by economic incentives to firms and households that are likely to be negatively impacted by the move.

The measures include a lockdown of five counties and a revised dusk-to-dawn curfew that will run indefinitely from 8pm to 4am.

But Sacco members and shareholders of listed banks will have some much-needed relief during this period as the financial institutions start making dividend payments for the last financial year.

It is against this backdrop that the management and board of some banks insist that the dividend payments are equivalent to a new stimulus package.

Deepak Dave, a financial expert, noted that if banks made a profit and can meet their regulatory capital needs, then they should pay dividends.

Subscribe to Our Newsletter Subscribe to our newsletter and stay updated on the latest developments and special offers!

“It would be a stimulus as well as demonstrate the strength of the financial system,” explained Dave.

Profitability for many banks declined after they made loan-loss provisions, anticipating an increase in loan defaults following the outbreak of Covid-19 in the country last year.

CBK data shows that the sector’s profit before tax dropped by almost a third to Sh112.8 billion in the financial year ending last year compared to Sh159.9 billion in 2019.

Another financial analyst, who did not want to be named as he is not allowed to speak to the media, noted that “the government should be absorbing pandemic shock losses, not socialising them by forcing banks to absorb more loan losses into their capital.”

“To solve that issue, let the government set up a fund using donor assistance to pay each bank what the borrowers lost due to Covid. That way, bad banks cannot sweep old mistakes into the general Covid excuse and force good banks to cover their old mistakes,” said the analyst.

So far five banks have made dividend payout amounting to Sh13.1 billion.

These are the Co-operative Bank of Kenya, KCB, NCBA and Stanbic Bank.

Co-operative Bank has announced a Sh3.8 billion dividend payout to its main shareholders, a majority of whom are cooperative societies, offering them a much-needed relief to navigate through the tough times.

In total, the bank paid Sh5.9 billion to all its shareholders.

“The current Covid-19 challenges have brought about the critical need to release the much-needed funds to the grassroots, in the over 15 million-member co-operative movement and in line with Capital Markets Authority guidelines, the bank is progressing to make this year’s dividend payment for ratification at the next Annual General Meeting,” said Co-operative Bank Chief Executive Gideon Muriuki in a statement. “The dividend payout is expected to offer a timely relief and offer a boost to ongoing efforts to mitigate the severe economic hardships caused by the Covid-19 pandemic,” he added.

NCBA, which paid Sh1.50 for every ordinary share held in the financial year ending December last year, will fork out a total of Sh2 billion to its shareholders.

Stanbic Bank, on the other hand, has paid out Sh1.5 billion to shareholders.

However, Equity Bank, which released its financial results yesterday, has withheld dividends for another year.

Following the announcement, the lender’s share price at the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) fell by 8.29 per cent, while that of NCBA rose by 8.23 per cent. But not every Kenyan will be lucky. If anything, a majority of ordinary Kenyans will find the going tough after most of the Covid-19 emergency measures lapsed, exposing them to a tough environment, with most of them losing their jobs or their salaries slashed.

The debt repayment holiday in which borrowers distressed by the pandemic were allowed to reschedule their loans by between six and 12 months without being charged restructuring fees was the latest to come to an end.

Banks had restructured loans valued at Sh1.7 trillion by the end of December, mostly for industries that have been hardest hit by the pandemic such as tourism, aviation and real estate.

Other tax relief measures aimed at leaving consumers with more disposable income saw taxpayers pay less in Pay as you earn (PAYE), Corporate Income Tax and the Valued Added Tax (VAT).

Central Bank of Kenya reduced its benchmark lending rate from 8.25 per cent before the outbreak to seven per cent, signalling cheap loans to the private sector.

The Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR), or the fraction of money that banks have to deposit with the financial regulator, was reduced to 4.5 per cent from 5.5 per cent. Transferring sums of Sh1,000 and below from one mobile wallet to another was also free.

Banks were not to charge any fees for the transfer of money between a bank account and a mobile money account.

Except for the free transfer of cash from bank accounts to mobile wallets and the reduction in CBK’s cash reserve ratio, most of these measures have lapsed.

However, the financial regulator has been nervy about letting banks ride roughshod over shareholders when it comes to dividend payment.

“It is true that the Central Bank has engaged all banks, and all banks have been doing stringent stress testing on capitals. Central Bank of Kenya accepted that it will approve any dividend and bonuses payout that the management board would propose,” Equity Chief Executive James Mwangi, noting that the bank had ridden the challenge of macro-economic uncertainty well.

Its deposits, he said, have grown by 53 per cent its loan book has expanded by a third.

“And if you look at the topline of Equity Bank, that is profitability before provisions, the profit has grown by 30 per cent,” he said at a press briefing in Nairobi.

“Given the momentum that we have built, the board felt it prudent to take advantage and ensure that the bank remains very well capitalised and opted to retain funds due to the macro-economic uncertainty,” said Mwangi.

This means that Equity shareholders will go for two financial years without dividend, with the second-largest bank by market size withdrawing the dividend it had announced last year after the country announced its first case of Covid-19. Mwangi is, however, optimistic that the group will bounce back this year and payout dividend next year.

Absa was the first top bank to withdraw dividend payout after the lender’s net profit dipped by 43.8 per cent on account of rising loan impairments.

“The directors did not recommend a dividend payout because Covid-19 is still here with us and we are expecting a big third wave. Until vaccinations have been done, we are still sceptical to say we are already on the recovery,” said Absa Bank Chief Finance Officer Yusuf Omari. However, most bank insiders insist that with the bank average liquidity ratio as of January at 54.9 per cent, way above the minimum statutory liquidity ratio of 20 per cent, most banks were in a position to pay dividends without leaving a gaping hole on their bottom line.",Business,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), the highest decision-making organ of the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), retained its benchmark lending rate at seven per cent for the ninth consecutive reporting period. This is after measures implemented to cushion firms and households against the adverse effects of Covid-19 had been successful.

“MPC noted that the package of policy measures implemented over the last year have protected the economy from substantial decline, and supported the most vulnerable citizens,” said CBK Governor Patrick Njoroge. The MPC concluded the current monetary policy stance remains appropriate.

Known as the Central Bank Rate (CBR), this is the rate at which banks borrow from CBK for forward lending to businesses.

CBR has been slashed from 8.25 before the pandemic, in what was aimed at availing cheap credit to borrowers distressed by the pandemic.

A while ago Deputy President William Ruto stirred the hornet’s nest when he launched a scathing attack on the government over heavy borrowing which continues to cripple the economy.

While some lambasted the DP for attacking the government he serves in, it is imperative to note that he was echoing sentiments expressed severally by Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi that the economy is bleeding because of the high debt and unless the National Treasury restructures and reschedules the national debt, the situation will worsen.

Going by the sentiments, it is clear time has come for Kenyans to have a conversation on the rising debt. Indeed, one of the challenges the post-Uhuru Kenyatta government will face is tackling the rising debt. According to the Central Bank of Kenya, the country’s public debt crossed the Sh7 trillion’s mark in August last year, comprising Sh3.4 trillion in domestic debt and Sh3.7 trillion in foreign loans.

The public finance management law set the debt ceiling at Sh9 trillion but the Treasury has warned that total debt, including committed balances that have not been disbursed, is edging closer to the ceiling.

Since 2013, the Jubilee government has been on a borrowing spree to get money to complete campaign pledges. Some of the projects include expansion of the road network by tarmacking of 10,000km; the Standard Gauge Railway; free maternity services in all public hospitals; upgrading of Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) Terminal 2 and slum clean up, among others.

Unfortunately, some of the borrowed money was misappropriated as recently disclosed by the President that the country was losing Sh2 billion daily to corruption. As Farmers Party, we submit that it is time the country held a conversation on the rising public debt.

We must take into account the fact that the decreasing revenue generation due to effects of the Covid-19 pandemic will mean the country has to allocate huge resources to repay the loans at the expense of education, healthcare, manufacturing and agriculture, which will further lower productivity and might even lead to default.

Some of the loans were also borrowed in mystery which is in breach of Article 201 of the 2010 Constitution that requires among other things openness and accountability, including public participation in financial matters.

It is to be recalled that in 2018, the then Auditor General Edward Ouko revealed that the government used the Mombasa port to secure the multi-billion shilling loan it took from China Exim Bank to build the SGR, leaving the cash-flush Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) exposed to seizure by the Chinese in the event of a default.

But Treasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani later denied reports that the Mombasa Port was at risk of takeover by China over defaulting loans though he shied away from stating whether the port had been used as collateral. We submit that the world is replete with examples of nations that mortgaged strategic assets to China for failure to service loans.

Zambia’s national electricity company ZESCO, a major airport and broadcasting corporation are under the threat of takeover for failure to meet loan repayments. Other countries such as Djibouti, Kyrgyzstan and Pakistan are facing debt-trap diplomacy in which China offers cheap infrastructure loans laced with the sting of default.

We also note that most of the mega projects the public will be financing debt repayment were awarded to foreign contractors who import skills and technical know-how from their countries and end up repatriating the financial resources.

The rising debt comes as the country’s key revenue sectors such as tea, coffee and sugar get crippled due to sheer neglect and corruption. The country’s high tax regime is also driving companies to shed off employees while international firms are avoiding Nairobi due to high taxation. It is time Kenyans demand debt management to be a key plank of the manifesto of political parties wishing to contest in elections.

All presidential aspirants must explain to voters how they will tackle this challenge if elected.

The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) yesterday threw borrowers into the shark-infested deep sea after it ended the emergency measures that had allowed them to restructure their loans.

This means the one-year holiday in which borrowers got reprieve, some of who lost their jobs, have ended and banks are at now liberty to book their loans as non-performing and subsequently go after their securities if they continue defaulting.

“Consequently, in accordance with standard procedures, borrowers whose loans were performing before March 2, 2020, but were restructured and subsequently went into arrears, will have three months (up to June 3, 2021) to regularise their loans,” said CBK in a statement yesterday.

Days after the country announced its first case of Covid-19 on March 13, last year, CBK struck a deal with banks that allowed loans that were not in arrears, but whose borrowers were negatively affected by the pandemic, to defer payment for between six and 12 months.

CBK noted that with these measures, borrowers were provided with restructuring options including an extension of the repayment period, a standstill on payment of principal or interest and waivers on interest or fees.

“The measures have provided space to borrowers to ride through the pandemic, mitigate job losses and pivot their business models to the new normal,” explained CBK.

The financial regulator noted that most of the restructured loans were already being serviced, with the outstanding restructured loans as of the end of February amounting to Sh569.3 billion, or 19 per cent of the total gross loans.

Since March last year, loans valued at Sh1.7 trillion, representing 57 per cent of the banks’ loan book, had been restructured.

“Over 95 per cent of the outstanding restructured loans are being repaid in accordance with the restructured terms,” said CBK Governor Patrick Njoroge.

It said with the end of the one year for the emergency measures on extension and restructuring of loans, the standard procedures for loan classification and provisioning would apply.

The measures might hurt borrowers and lenders. With the economy yet to recover from the after-shocks of the Covid-19 pandemic, banks might have to book most of their loans as bad loans.

Provisioning for them will eating into their profitability. Banks have the option of trying to recover the loans by auctioning some of the borrowers’ assets. But a tough business environment means that there will be fewer takers of those assets.

Nonetheless, CBK which noted that these emergency measures provided banks with time to build additional capital and liquidity buffers to take them through the pandemic period and beyond, will now expect them to start provisioning for such risky loans.

“Specifically, banks will from March 3, 2021, assess the performance of all restructured loans that were performing before March 2, 2020. The period for determining the performance of all the restructured loans will begin on March 3, 2021.”",Business,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

The Cabinet Secretary for Health Mutahi Kagwe has underscored the role of social protection programmes’ to ease economic challenges associated with the Covid 19 pandemic.



Speaking when he delivered the Guest of Honour speech at the twenty-third African Economic Research Consortium (AERC) Virtual Senior Policy Seminar, Kagwe noted that well thought out social protection programmes will act as safeguards for the economically vulnerable.



Social protection initiatives, he said, support positive health outcomes by mitigating economic shocks, such as income losses resulting from the measures governments have imposed to contain the spread of COVID-19.



The seminar, which features delegates from across the continent, including Central Bank Governors, Finance and Economic Affairs Ministers among other stakeholders, is this year being hosted under the theme: “The Global COVID-19 Health Pandemic and Its Implications for the African Economies”.



In his address, Kagwe noted that, with new infections on the rise, it is a race against time for governments to re-look at some policy interventions necessary to provide appropriate coping and recovery mechanisms to respond to the crisis.



“Social protection is an effective way to protect immediate human needs and to cushion economic reversals by protecting productive assets,” he said. He added that “If governments have channels in place that they can use to put income into people’s hands when they lose their livelihoods, they can forestall losses that might set economic recovery back years.”



Learning from the Kenyan example, Kagwe advised Economic Policy stakeholders to consider adopting social protection measures such as the Kazi Mtaani initiative. “The objective is to avoid panic sales of productive assets, ensure households keep a roof over their heads, help small businesses to pay wages of furloughed staff, and to provide public works employment while the informal sector is paralyzed,” he said.



Other speakers at the seminar included AERC Executive Director Njuguna Ndung’u, and Arqebe Oqubay, Senior Minister and Advisor to the Prime Minister of Ethiopia, who delivered the keynote speech.



The current Covid-19 pandemic is damaging business ecosystems, affecting livelihoods, and threatening to overturn sub-Saharan Africa’s development progress and growth projections.



The pandemic has brought to the fore economic challenges and exposed many institutions’ frailty across the continent. Yet, as the virus was late in arriving on the continent, we saw governments across Africa taking decisive actions to keep citizens safe and implementing global best practices and policies.

NAIROBI, KENYA: Capital Markets Authority (CMA) has fined ex-board directors of Real People Kenya Limited and Real People Investment Holdings Sh15m for misuse of Sh1.3b bond proceeds.



In a statement on Wednesday, CMA said the four board directors will further be banned from holding a director position at any fund manager listed on the capital markets.



“The CMA has taken enforcement action against former board members of RPKL as well as current and former board members of RPIHL, South Africa for their role in the misapplication of the Sh1.3 billion MTN proceeds,” said CMA in its statement in part.



According to the regulator, RPKL received approval in 2015 for a Sh5billion (medium-term note) MTN programme, but after raising Sh1.6billion, the firm experienced financial challenges leading to an extension of maturity dates past the 3-year and 5-year statutory periods.



“CMA initiated an investigation into the matter and noted that there appeared to have been a plan involving RPKL and RPIHL, South Africa to use the MTN proceeds to settle an inter-company loan even before the application, approval, and issue of the MTN,” explained the regulator in its statement.



The investigations found a lack of effective oversight on the part of RPKL’s board on how the proceeds of the medium-term notes would be used.



“The approved and published Information Memorandum (IM) dated June 25, 2015, provided that the MTN proceeds would be used by RPKL for lending to clients in the small and micro-sized enterprises (MSME) sector in Kenya,” explains the CMA. “On the contrary, MTN proceeds were used to settle Related Party Loan in South Africa.”



Arthur Arnold, RPKL’s Board Chairman at the time has been fined KES 5 million and disqualified from being a director or key personnel of any issuer, licensed or approved person in the country’s capital markets.



The same action has been taken against Neil Grobbelaar, RPKL Board Member and Chief Executive Officer of RPHIL at the material time.



Arumugam Padachie, RPIHL Board Member and Group Chief Finance Officer at the time and Bruce Schenk, the alternate director to Neil Grobbelaar on RPKL board and Executive Director of RHIPL at the material time have been fined Sh2.5million each and disqualified from being the director or key personnel of any issuer, licensed or approved person in the Kenyan capital market.



The disqualifications will only be lifted once the bondholders recover their money in full together with the accrued interest.

No enforcement action was taken against other senior executives of the company including James Mwai Mbui, former RPKL Chief Information Officer, Bruce Evans, former RPIHL Group Head of Corporate Finance and Werner Nel, former RPHIL Group Head of Treasury.",Business,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

The slopes of Mt Kenya and the Aberdare embrace and merge akin to Siamese twins in their mother's womb.

They are similar in their verdure, beauty and profusion of life, a phenomenon abundantly manifest in the fauna, flora, fresh air and springs, fountains and brooks that coalesce into rivers, including the mighty Tana.

Like conjoined twins, the slopes share a common profile. They were the preferred hideout for Kenya’s gallant Mau Mau fighters who bravely battled colonialists to liberate the nation for posterity. Some of these brave fighters are still alive today, albeit with little or nothing to show for their sacrifice.

They quintessentially are heroes forgotten and forsaken by the very nation they liberated through so much pain and anguish. Most are navigating their twilight years in abject poverty, bereft of everything but fresh air and water that though dwindling under climate change, still trickles down the slopes.

Eighty-five-year-old Milton Munene Gacau, popularly known by his bush name of ‘Judge’ by dint of his relatively high level of education – having gone to school to junior secondary level when he joined Mau Mau in 1953 – is a living testimony of that neglect.

He returned home in 1959 to find all his family land gobbled up because colonial authorities had decreed that fighters, who failed to surrender in exchange for amnesty when the state of emergency was lifted in 1955, be denied land ownership and any form of freedom. Chiefs religiously enforced the decree.

When he was lucky to get a job in the civil service and bought a piece of land in the neighbourhood of his ancestral home, a powerful senior civil servant who hailed from the area used his influence and financial muscle to wrest it from him and instigated his termination from service, besides ensuring that he was an outlaw in Nairobi.

“I had worked for less than five years when I was surprisingly retired in public interest in 1973. In what felt like a thunder strike shortly afterwards, orders came from the director of criminal investigations, a Mr Ruingu, that I must not be seen in Nairobi. I was given a security officer to escort me home to Kirinyaga, but he was friendly and took me to Machakos instead,"" recalls Gacau.

He says he was among those fighters who had taken an oath never to surrender. ""I remained in the forest until I was captured in 1956 and taken first for rehabilitation in Yatta then direct to detention in Hola where I remained until 1959 when detention camps were closed,"" he says.

Among his contemporaries at the notorious Hola detention camp, where 11 detainees were bludgeoned to death in a horrific massacre on January 3, 1959, were Muinga Chokwe, a founder of the Kenya African Union (KAU) from the Coast, Waira Kamau, the first MP for Githunguri Constituency at independence, John O’Washika, a colonial era court clerk, and Romano Gikunju Njamino, the first senator of Kirinyaga, to mention but a few.

Bloodbath

Gacau says he was in the contingent of detainees deployed to dig canals at the Bura Irrigation Scheme when the bloodbath happened.

“The colonial guards rounded up about 80 hardcore individuals who refused to work and mercilessly brutalised them as we watched. Apart from the dead whose bodies were loaded on a tipper and driven away for burial at the camp, many were maimed and hospitalised with serious injuries,” he recollects.

Before Bura, Gacau was in the squad that built the Hola District Hospital at Laza, only a few kilometres from the detention camp. “We worked like slaves, amid beatings at the whims of the guards with little to eat. We led a donkey’s life, literally,” he says.

When he returned home from detention in August 1959, he joined Kanu to continue with the struggle against colonial rule. He was elected chairman of the party in Kabare Location while his fellow Hola detainee Romano Njamino was elected the Embu District Kanu branch chairman. Present day Kirinyaga County was then part of Embu.

Gacau worked in his brother’s farm and just as he had done in detention where he sensed free moments to study by correspondence through British Tutorial College, he continued honing his education. “I combined my studies with teaching my fellow detainees at Hola. Njamino was among my students,” he recalls.

Gacau says Njamino saw his education getting wasted in the village and recommended him for a job in a Kanu newspaper run by Pio Gama Pinto in Nairobi.

“I was 27. Pinto, a close ally of Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, recommended that I be considered for scholarship to further my education overseas. It was the time Tom Mboya was airlifting students to the west while Jaramogi was doing so to the East.

Unicef, through the Odinga-Kanu wing, awarded him a scholarship in Czechoslovakia.

Forlorn picture

Gacau says he spent seven years at Prague University where he majored in economics and social studies after studying the Czech language.

“I secured a job as a trade officer in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry immediately on my return to Kenya in 1969,” he says.

“My monthly salary was Sh1,300, a substantial sum then. The seven-acre piece of land was to cost me Sh13,000 that I had nearly completed paying. I had 2,000 tea bushes on it by the time the title deed was diverted after the powerful man offered more money. I was terribly devastated and have remained landless since,” laments Gacau.

His brother gave him less than an acre of land on which he built a semi-permanent house in 2000.

In the previous year, the mortgage lender made a loss after tax of Sh110 million in 2019.

This follows a tough operating environment for the listed lender that saw its revenues decline even as its expenses increased.

The lender’s revenue fell by a third from Sh3.37 billion to Sh2.38 billion. On the other hand, its expenses rose by 15 per cent from Sh3.51 billion to Sh4.05 billion.

Family Bank has reported a net profit of Sh1.16 billion in the year ended December 31, 2020, up from Sh949 million in 2019.

The bank’s total non-performing loans, however, increased from Sh7.13 billion in 2019 to Sh8.08 billion in 2020 as distressed borrowers defaulted on their loans, or had them restructured due to the negative impact of Covid-19 on the economy and livelihoods.

The group, in results released yesterday, reported a 14.9 per cent growth in total asset value to Sh90.59 billion, buoyed by an increase in loans and advances to customers that hit Sh56.58 billion. Customer deposits registered a growth of 20.3 per cent to Sh69.76 billion during the period under review.

The bank’s liquidity position stood at 37.1 per cent, well above the minimum requirement of 20 per cent. “Our loan book expanded by 11.8 per cent year on year to close at Sh56.6 billion as we continued to support our customers who saw new opportunities despite the Covid-19 pandemic. This support was in diverse sectors such as manufacturing, agribusiness, trade, logistics and technology,” said Chief Executive Rebecca Mbithi.

The bank’s net interest income increased from Sh5 billion to Sh6.43 billion year-to-year.

Operating expenses, on the other hand, increased by 20.2 per cent to Sh7.67 billion from Sh6.38 billion, mainly driven by loan-loss provisions, which more than doubled from Sh734 million in 2019 to Sh1.62 billion last year.

Total non-funded income dropped to Sh2.7 billion, which the bank attributed to the waiver on mobile transaction fees that to cushion customers against the adverse effects of the coronavirus pandemic.

“Looking ahead, our 2020 to 2024 strategy continues to be pegged on delivering end-to-end value chain propositions that begin from delivering an unmatched digital and customer experience, growing our pool of strategic partners to diversifying solutions targeted at different customers in our value chain,” said Ms Mbithi.

“This means that Kenyans will endure more pain amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Like we may all know that the costs of energy and transport have a significant weighting in the basket of goods and services that is used to measure inflation in the country,” said ICPAK Chairman Rose Mwaura.

“Petrol prices have jumped by sh15.82 over the past two months, making it one of the biggest jumps over the period since 2007,” said Mwaura.

Mwaura said 2021 has been characterised by several major and far-reaching tax changes in Kenya including a digital services tax at the rate of 1.5 per cent of the transaction value.

In a study published Thursday, researchers at the non-partisan Pew Research Centre found that the ranks of the global middle class - those “middle income” and “upper-middle income” people earning $10-$20 (Sh1,090 - Sh2,180) and $20-$50 (Sh2,180 to Sh5,450) per day respectively - fell by 90 million people to almost 2.5 billion last year.

That helped swell the ranks of the poor, or those living on less than $2 a day, by 131 million, Pew estimated.

The Pew data on the middle class actually understates the impact because an estimated 62 million high-income people, or those earning $50 or more per day, dropped into the middle tier as a result of the pandemic, said Rakesh Kochhar, the study’s author.

That suggests the number of people who went into the crisis as members of the global middle class and fell out actually topped 150 million last year, according to Pew’s estimates - more than the population of France and Germany combined.

“In modern history it is hard to come up with examples where you saw such a sharp downturn in global economic growth,” Kochhar said in an interview.

The impact also may not be over. Concerns are growing about the potential consequences of a slower recovery in emerging economies and the continuing fallout from the crisis.

Brazil’s central bank on Wednesday announced its biggest increase in its policy rate in a decade in response to growing fears of inflation.

Economists are also watching the possible fallout for emerging nations of rising US Treasury yields and a strengthening dollar as the US economy accelerates.

If the Pew estimate holds true in actual World Bank income data still being gathered, it would mark an end to a pattern that has seen the global middle class expand without fail since the 1990s thanks to the rapid growth of developing economies like China and India.

When Pew last calculated the number of the world’s middle-income earners - or those with incomes of $10-$20 per day - in 2011, they made up 13 per cent of the global population.

By 2019, that had grown to nearly 18 per cent, Kochhar said, with an average of 50 million people a year joining the middle-income ranks over the past decade.

In a separate paper published Monday based on surveys of 47,000 households in 34 developing countries with a collective population of almost 1.4 billion people, researchers at the World Bank found that 36 per cent of households saw job losses last year and almost two-thirds saw incomes fall.

The result was the first increase in global poverty seen since the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98, the bank’s researchers wrote.

Slower recoveries

As in many rich countries, the surveys of countries ranging from Burkina Faso to Colombia, Indonesia and Vietnam show the burden of the economic hit disproportionately fell on women, young people and the self-employed in urban centers.

But they also point to the consequences that slower recoveries are expected to have. While the US has unleashed unprecedented fiscal rescue efforts for its economy, many developing economies have had smaller resources to draw on.

According to the World Bank, as of September 2020, advanced economies had on average spent 7.4 per cent of gross domestic product on rescuing businesses and people hit by the pandemic versus 3.8 per cent of gross domestic product in emerging markets and 2.4 per cent in low-income developing countries.",Business,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

On Thursday, the Mitumba Consortium Association of Kenya launched a report on the state of the second-hand clothes and footwear sector.

The report dubbed ‘The State of Second-Hand Clothes and Footwear Trade in Kenya’, published by the Institute of Economic Affairs seeks to examine the structure and extent of the used clothing industry in Kenya, and its contributions to the economy.

The report paints a picture of the sector's contribution to the economy, notes textile industry and second-hand clothes and footwear sectors can co-exist in Kenya.

“Based on the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) Manpower Survey, the industry employs an estimated 10 per cent of the extended labour force, which translates to at least 2 million people,” said the Mitumba Consortium Association of Kenya Chairperson, Teresiah Njenga.

The report notes that it is a mistake to believe the expansion of textile manufacturing will only proceed if the existing mitumba sector is weakened or reduced in size.

The cost of living went up for the seventh consecutive month as prices of essential commodities rose at a time when most consumers are struggling.

Year-on-year inflation or the overall rise in the prices of goods and services reached 5.78 per cent last month compared to 5.69 per cent in January.

Non-food and non-fuel inflation, remained largely in check, an indication that the increase in the prices of products has not been informed by increased demand but low supply of food and fuel.

The acceleration in the overall prices of goods and services was driven largely by cooking oil, sukuma wiki, cabbages, and mangoes, whose unit prices increased by 17.8 per cent, 13.3 per cent, 9.1 per cent and 8.69 per cent respectively.

As a result, said the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), which compiled the report said the month-to-month food and non-alcoholic drinks’ index increased by 1.01 per cent between January 2021 and February 2021.

“The food inflation was mainly attributed to an increase in prices of some food items which outweighed the decrease in prices of other foodstuffs,” said KNBS in a statement on Saturday.

Cooking oil registered the highest jump with a kilo retailing at Sh236.45 last month, compared to Sh200.7 in February 2020.

Beginning early last year, bad weather, low use of fertiliser and shortage of manpower triggered by social distance measures imposed by countries during the pandemic, depressed the production of palm oil in Asia, leading to the surge in prices of cooking oil in Kenya.

Crude palm oil is the main ingredient used in the manufacture of cooking oil in Kenya.

The scarcity in some of the items was compounded by a decrease in disposable income for Kenyans following the adverse effects of Covid-19, which saw them lose jobs.

Moreover, the tax relief measures that the government had given to Kenyans to cushion them against the negative effects of the pandemic have since been rolled back, making some of the products expensive for Kenyans.

However, during this period, prices of tomatoes decreased by an average of 24.1 per cent with a kilo retailing at Sh97.40, down from Sh128.40 in February last year.

“Prices of lemons, mangoes and maize grain decreased by 5.64, 0.33 and 0.18 per cent, respectively,” said KNBS.

Retail prices of kerosene and diesel also declined by 9.9 per cent and 2.4 per cent respectively.

“The housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels’ index, increased by 0.43 per cent between January and February 2021. This was mainly attributed to an increase in the price of kerosene by 6.02 per cent between January 2021 and February 2021.”

Thermal power plants are losing their shine in the country’s energy sector mix due to various factors, including investments in geothermal sources and favourable weather patterns.

The investment in cheaper sources of energy has started to bear fruit, and the rains have led to an increase in power generation from hydropower plants.

While the power generated from costly and environmentally destructive plants has drastically reduced, coupled with the reduction in fuel costs, Kenyans will continue to bear the huge costs associated with these plants for years as some contracts will take long to lapse.

The reduction in the amount of power that thermal plants feed into the electricity grid is seen in the recently published Kenya Power financials for the period to June 2020.

The power utility firm said the money it spent on buying electricity from thermal power producers reduced by about 40 per cent over the year.

“Fuel cost decreased by 39.5 per cent from Sh18.29 billion from the previous year to Sh11.06 billion due to lower utilisation of thermal plants,” said Kenya Power.

“Units generated from thermal plants decreased by 416 gigawatt-hours (GWh) from 1,298 GWh the previous year to 882 GWh, a 32 per cent decrease.”

The power utility firm noted that these costs had dropped further in the half-year to December 2020 to Sh4.62 billion, compared to Sh7.15 billion over a similar half in 2019.

Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen) in its report for the half-year to December 2020 noted that thermal power plants had reduced their share in its ecosystem to only two per cent.

This has over time come down from upwards of 10 per cent.

“Increased hydro production displaced thermal generation whose contribution declined from six per cent during the period to two per cent for the period ended December 31, 2020,” said the power producer.

The reduced reliance on thermal plants would have meant power prices would go down.

Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) data shows that a family consuming 200 units (kWh) of power every month paid Sh4,800 in January this year, seven per cent more than the Sh4,480 they paid in January 2020.

Energy Cabinet Secretary Charles Keter said the State has reduced the amount of thermal power it feeds into the national electricity grid.

Manageable levels

While it may seem the cost of power has always been on the rise, Keter said major milestones have been achieved, including the retiring of emergency power plants as well as reducing power from thermal plants to manageable levels.

This, he said, has slowed the pace at which retail power prices have increased. He explained that the increase in power prices in recent years has been due to many factors, including inflation.

“We have managed to shed-off expensive emergency thermal power from our grid and diversified the generation mix through a portfolio of projects developed by public and private entities,” he said.

“We have generally stabilised prices and reduced the cost of power in real terms over the last decade. To achieve further gains, we are enhancing our transmission network to address constraints and enable more optimal utilisation of geothermal and other renewable energy sources.”

The CS said the State has supported national electrification and increased usage of clean energy - achieving lower overall electricity unit costs.

He added that it would take time before Kenyans benefit from reduced thermal capacity on the pricing of power, including the need by investors in renewable energy power plants to recoup their money.

This is due to high costs in the early days after operationalisation of a power plant, which reduces as plants age.

“We have managed to bring down thermal generation to a level that does not result in wide fluctuations in power prices due to variations in global oil prices,” Keter said.

“Other than the generation mix, overall power prices are determined by a blend of factors. Investments in alternatives to thermal power also need to be amortised, and new capacity added to the grid comes at a cost. We have in the recent past integrated new renewable energy sources to the grid.”

Renewable plants

He said the power that comes on board from the renewable plants is priced lower than the thermal plants they are displacing.

But while thermal plants might not be supplying as much power to the grid as they have in the past, there is still a cost that is passed on to consumers in the form of capacity charges.

Global food prices rose for an eighth consecutive month in January to their highest since July 2014, the United Nations food agency said on Thursday, as economies continue to battle fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic.

The Food and Agriculture Organisation’s (FAO) food price index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 113.3 points last month December’s 108.6, revised up from 107.5.

Jumps in cereals, sugar and vegetable oils led the rise, the agency said.

Some governments are taking action to tackle surging domestic food prices, although such moves drive global values higher by reducing supplies for international markets. Tabitha Jelimo preparing porridge at Chebanda village in Tiaty, Baringo County on April 7,2019. [Kipsang Joseph, Standard]

Acute hunger

The consequence is already evident in grain prices, such as corn, hitting multi-year highs.

Grain-consuming giant China is stockpiling supplies, while Argentina has suspended sales of maize for export until February 28. Russia is imposing taxes on exports of wheat, barley and maize.

The World Bank said in December that food price increases, combined with reduced incomes, had aggravated chronic and acute hunger, hitting vulnerable households in almost every country.

The Rome-based FAO said in a statement that worldwide cereal harvests remained on course for an annual record in 2020, but warned of a sharp fall in stocks and signalled unexpectedly large import demands from China.

FAO’s cereal price index climbed 7.1 per cent month-on-month in January, led higher by international maize prices.

They soared 11.2 per cent, some 42.3 per cent above their level a year ago, buoyed in part by purchases by China and lower-than-expected US production. Wheat prices increased 6.8 per cent, driven by strong global demand and expectations of reduced sales by Russia when its wheat export duty doubles in March 2021, FAO said.

Sugar jumped 8.1 per cent, with worries about worsening crop prospects in the European Union, Russia and Thailand, and dry weather in South America, pushing up import demand. A weak shilling and a host of disruptive factors in some of the country’s key source markets have led to a spike in retail prices. [Standard, File]

The vegetable oil price index increased 5.8 per cent to its highest level since May 2012, driven in part by lower-than-expected palm oil production in Indonesia and Malaysia.

Soyoil prices were fuelled by reduced export opportunities and prolonged strikes in Argentina.

Kenya Airways has been handed some reprieve with the government exempting it from paying income tax.

In a gazette notice, National Treasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani said the company will be exempted from paying the recently introduced minimum tax, which compels loss-making firms to pay tax on revenues as opposed to the trade taxation on profit.

The tax, introduced as an amendment to the Income Tax Act by the Finance Act 2020, requires all firms to pay the tax “regardless of whether or not they make a profit”.

“In the exercise of the power conferred by… the Income Tax Act, the CS for the National Treasury and Planning directs that the income derived from or accrued by a Kenya airline in which the government owns at least 40 per cent of its shares, and the subsidiaries of that airline, shall be exempt from the provision of section 12D of the Act,” reads the gazette notice signed by CS Yatani.

The carrier is expected to get more of such exemptions when its ownership reverts to the State. The exemption will save KQ about Sh528 million, a paltry amount considering the carrier recently announced it would need Sh55 billion over the next year.

KQ’s revenues stood at Sh52.81 billion last year, with Covid-19 being blamed on the 59 per cent decline from Sh128.32 billion in 2019.

Last year, it received a tax credit of Sh354 million on account of the emergency measures put in place by the State, including the requirement to pay lower corporate tax at 25 per cent.

The carrier reported a net loss of Sh36.2 billion, the worst ever in its history, attributed to the harsh times occasioned by Covid-19. Even before the pandemic, the carrier had been experiencing challenges and was implementing a turnaround strategy.

Kenyans transferred more than Sh1 trillion through mobile money in the last three months of last year.

According to industry statistics from the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA), the value of a person to person cash transfers marked a 15 per cent increase to Sh1,031 billion compared to Sh896 billion recorded in the three months ending September 2020.

“The number of active registered mobile money subscriptions stood at 32.5 million, while the number of active mobile money agents stood at 264,390 during the review period,” said the Authority in its report.

Customer to business transfers recorded a 33 per cent increase from Sh735 billion in the first quarter of the 2020/21 financial year to Sh983 billion as more consumers shunned cash payments to curb the spread of Covid-19.

The figures highlight the significant rise in digital transactions recorded by fintech and telcos in the last financial year.

“Contrary to the preceding 2 quarters, the number of SIM additions declined during the period under review to 1.6 million from 2.8 million net additions posted in September 2020,” explained CA in its report.

Local voice traffic grew by 8.2 per cent to stand at 19.6 billion minutes in December, largely dominated by Safaricom that accounted for 69.2 per cent of the market share.

Airtel registered 5.6 billion minutes originating from its mobile network, down from 5.8 billion minutes reported in the preceding quarter, cutting the telco’s market share down to 28.5 per cent, from 32 per cent recorded in the previous quarter.

In the fixed data segment, Safaricom widened its market lead against traditional market leader Wananchi Group that has traditionally held the top spot over the past decade.

The government has set up a committee to review all existing agreements that Kenya Power has signed with electricity producers in its latest bid to tame power prices, with previous attempts have been futile.

President Uhuru Kenyatta on Monday gazetted the new task force on the review of Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). The team will relook into the contracts that dictate how KPLC pays the power producers.

Such contracts have been partly blamed for the high cost of electricity to the disadvantage of Kenya Power. The committee comes two weeks after the Energy Ministry gazetted a committee to undertake similar roles but was hastily degazetted days after the appointment.

Energy Cabinet Secretary Charles Keter then said there was a need to make the committee more inclusive. The task force to be chaired by John Ngumi will have six months to look into the PPAs and give recommendations on the way forward, including the possibility of renegotiating or terminating the contracts.

Other members are Solicitor General Kennedy Ogeto, CBK Chair Mohammed Nyaoga, former Chief Justice Aaron Ringera and Sachen Gudka. During the six months, the president placed a moratorium on negotiations of PPAs while directing non-renewal of contracts that will expire in the course of the period.

According to the gazette notice, the terms of the reference of the task force include undertaking “a comprehensive review and analysis of the terms of all PPAs entered in to by KPLC.”

The committee will also develop a strategy for the engagement with independent power reproducers and lenders, “to achieve relief for electricity consumers and ensure the long-term viability and sustainability of the sector.”

The cost of power has been a thorny issue. The sector has in the past cited the high cost of power that increase the cost of manufactured goods.

NAIROBI, KENYA: Pressure is piling on the government to revise recent restrictions aimed at checking the spread of the Corona Virus.

In a statement, the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KNCCI) is calling on the state to lift the lockdown in Nakuru, Kiambu, Machakos, and Kajiado among other proposals that would squeeze individuals and businesses across the country.

The Chamber proposes a four-day lockdown in Nairobi because of the high number of cases recorded in the county. During the lockdown in the city, it says mass testing should be conducted and those identified as positive cases should be isolated in home-based care and be taken through treatment.

From the results of mass testing, the county zones with the highest positive cases should be marked as red zone while areas with lower rates of infection marked as Green Zones. The lobby group says strict enforcement should be enforced to ensure those in the red zone do not move in green zones.

“The zoning model worked well in China during the peak of its pandemic and could be borrowed as a best practice for Kenya at this time,” says Richard Ngatia, President, Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

“After the process has been completed in Nairobi, the same procedure shall be mapped on the next most infected county until all citizens get vaccinated,” he added.

In his speech last week the President adjusted curfew hours in Nairobi, Kiambu, Machakos, Nakuru and Kajiado to 8 pm from 10 pm and ends at 4 am, among other measures that have proved to be a challenge to many individuals and businesses.

He banned the sale of alcohol in bars and restaurants in the said counties. However, he ordered eateries and restaurants to operate on a take-away basis.

International travellers have also not been spared after Uhuru commanded that those travelling into and out of the territory of Kenya possess a negative Covid-19 PCR certificate acquired no more than 96 hours earlier.

When similar containment measures were introduced last year, the government announced various packages to cushion Kenyans from the economic damage, the president however last week offered no financial remedy.

Cushioning Businesses.

Ngatia said the chamber has received appeals from business calling on the government to reconsider certain measures and incentives given to the businesses to ensure continuity and sustainability.

To safeguard businesses, the chamber wants the State to revise downwards current fuel prices, offer small businesses recovery financing stimulus, and for banks to offer moratoriums and extend existing loan repayments.

Other items in the proposal include the revision of Value Added Tax to 14 per cent, allowing hotels, eateries to re-open under strict guidelines, the 1 per cent minimum tax be frozen to cushion small businesses and quick resolution of tax disputes to help unlock Sh400 billion into economy.

NAIROBI, KENYA: The Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) has allayed fears of negative impact on operations at the Port of Mombasa as an aftermath of the Suez Canal crisis.

Acting Managing Director Rashid Salim said the impact on port operations will be minimal.

“We will experience very minimal impact from the Suez Canal blockage in terms of container vessels as it will only affect cargo from Europe and the Americas normally transshipped from the Gulf ports,” he observed.

Rashid noted that the blockage is now not a problem following clearance on Monday. In a statement, he did not foresee much of an impact given that imports are mainly from Asia.

Cargo from Europe and the Americas account for less than 35 per cent of imports.

He said major shipping lines plying trade routes had indicated that the negative impact would be a slight delay for their 1st carrier transhipment vessels.

""There was only one vessel that had left the Port of Mombasa to Europe which by the time of the incident had already cleared the Suez Canal,"" he noted.

According to the acting Managing Director, exports mainly refrigerated Avocados to Europe and America could experience slight delays. Fresh produce is currently the main export commodity to Europe.

General Manager Operations and Harbour William Ruto added that on the likelihood of any delays on grain vessels and possible bunching up of ship arrivals, the Authority was on top level preparedness with reviewed operational strategies in place.

Meanwhile formal investigations into how the giant container ship Ever Given ran aground in the Suez Canal, shutting down shipping in the major global waterway for almost a week, begun on Wednesday, a canal official told Reuters.

Suez Canal Authority (SCA) Chairman Osama Rabie has suggested weather conditions, including high winds, and human error could have played a role in the grounding on March 23.

The investigation will include examining the seaworthiness of the ship and its captain’s actions to help determine the causes, Rabie advisor Captain Sayed Sheasha told Reuters.

The Ever Given’s captain was committed to fully complying with the probe, which will start on Wednesday, Sheasha said.

Kenya Vision 2030, a State initiative that aims to transform the country into a newly industrialised, middle-income nation, is on a mission to demystify golf in Kenya.

Kenya Vision 2030 is out to narrow the gap between top international pros and the local players.

“We have realised there’s a great difference in the mental strength of our golfers as compared to their international counterparts. This is what has hindered our pros from being champions.

“We are out to bridge this gap,” Kenneth Mwige, the Vision 2030 director general told Standard Sports.

However, Mwige feels the task is too big to accomplish alone.

It is on this note that he is challenging other corporates to come on board and adopt a golfer at the start of the 2021/2022 Safari Tour series, to help the players prepare extensively ahead of next year’s European Tour events.

“By supporting the golfers directly, we help them to cut down the costs and expenses they would have incurred in their preparation.

“This gives them peace of mind as they train hard and take part in the Safari Tour circuit ahead of the Magical Kenya Open,” Mwige said.

Mwige insists corporates don’t need to sink much money in the relationship. “Even Sh100,000 will be such a big boost to the players,” he says.

Mwige feels the support to the players should be institutionalised so it will be all season affair. “Our aim is to make this support all year affair, not just for a certain period,” he said.

Through investing in these players, Mwige says corporates stand to reap big returns.

After empowering the golfers financially, Mwige says they should be taken through a series of training to help them become mentally tough for championships.

Former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry said the debate over whether soccer players should take a knee before games has diverted attention from the real issue of addressing racial discrimination.

Players in England's top flight have been taking a knee since July, initially in support of the 'Black Lives Matter' movement before the Premier League and English Football League linked the gesture to their own anti-racism campaigns.

Crystal Palace's Wilfried Zaha became the first Premier League player this month not to take a knee after he said the meaning of the gesture, which he called ""degrading"", has been lost.

""There was the debate recently about taking the knee or standing, but that's not the debate,"" former France international Henry, who suffered racial abuse during his playing career, told CNN Sport.

""That's not the cause. The cause is: What are you going to do for it to be better for everybody? Equality. Everybody, and obviously I'm going to talk about my community.

""I thought kneeling was a strong message and we all know where it comes from, but then the discussion moved to: Are we standing or are we kneeling?""

Henry said the point was not whether to take the knee, but the racism itself, which still goes on, and how to tackle it.

Henry, 43, last week deleted his social media accounts to protest against the platforms for not taking action against anonymous account holders who are guilty of racist]m and bullying online.

His former club Arsenal on Tuesday launched a #StopOnlineAbuse action plan aimed at tackling online abuse.

A new taskforce has been created to provide support for players when online abuse occurs, and the club said it will pursue legal action and ban any Arsenal fan found responsible for any ""unacceptable comments"".

English soccer's governing bodies have urged social media companies to tackle the problem in the wake of racist messages aimed at players.

[Jonah Onyango, Standard]

Football Kenya Federation (FKF) president Nick Mwendwa believes a quick return to FKF Premier League action will help in national team Harambee Stars’ preparations ahead of 2022 World Cup Qualifiers in June.

This comes barely a week after President Uhuru Kenyatta indefinitely suspended all sporting activities in the country and imposed partial lock-down in Nairobi, Kajiado, Machakos, Kiambu and Nakuru counties as one of the measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19.

The directive came just as the league was taking shape with each team having played at least 14 matches (three less than halfway mark) behind closed doors and in adherence to the Covid-19 protocol.

But having already engaged Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed, Mwendwa said his federation is set to vaccinate all Premier League players and officials before resumption.

“The CS has told me to write to the Sports Ministry. She is keen that if we implement some of the things to prevent the spread of Covid-19, then we can get back to action as soon as possible,” said Mwendwa

""We have been playing behind closed doors (without fans), but since the vaccines are here, she (Amina) wants us to vaccinate all our players and officials in the league. But moving forward, the issues of PCR tests will not arise again more so, in international matches after a vaccine certificate is issued. Football Kenya Federation president Nick Mwendwa. [David Njaaga, Standard]

“It is because of our active league that our players were sharp against Egypt and Togo. For a player like Hassan (Abdallah) to score three goals in three matches speak a lot about the level of our league and that’s why we must have our league going on as we head into the World Cup qualifiers in June.”

Mwendwa’s sentiments were echoed by Harambee Stars captain Michael Olunga who was impressed by the performance of the local-based players in their last two 2021 Afcon qualifiers matches against Egypt (1-1) and Togo (1-2).

“The World Cup qualifiers is going to be a different competition altogether because the magnitude of the competition is much bigger than Afcon. Each player knows the seriousness of the games,” said Olunga.

“But the only challenge is with President Uhuru Kenyatta’s decision to ban sports because the qualifiers are coming up very soon. I hope it's not going to affect us.”",Sports,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/
https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/sports/football/2001408138/why-mwendwa-wants-caf-to-handle-covid-19-tests,Why Mwendwa wants CAF to handle COVID-19 tests,"Having twice witnessed Harambee Stars fall victim to the alleged Covid-19 failed tests, Football Kenya Federation (FKF) president Nick Mwendwa now wants the Confederation of African Football (CAF) to have a neutral testing body.

The national team, who beat Togo 2-1 in Lome on Monday to finish third in Group G of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers with seven points, were first hit by claims of players testing positive for the virus when they lost 2-1 to Comoros in Moroni last year.

What followed was a six-month suspension of FKF Chief Executive Officer Barry Otieno and Harambee Stars team manager Ronny Oyando for breaching Covid-19 regulations after they they allegedly tore Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test copies of the Kenyan team in protest of the results.

As per the PCR tests, four Harambee Stars players were said to have tested positive before the match but went on to play thus risked spreading the virus to others.

And it was the same case in Lome on Monday night when the quartet of captain Michael Olunga, goalkeeper Ian Otieno, defender Joash Onyango and midfielder Lawrence Juma missed the fixture after the host federation claimed they had tested positive for the virus.

But while questioning the motive behind Togo’s FA, Mwendwa urged the continental body to quickly address the players’ testing issue that is now becoming a concern in African football.

“Covid-19 is bringing some challenges that we have to deal with in Africa. We have to think about this because Uganda were complaining and eventually Miya (Farouk) played even though he was being told he was positive. We (Kenya) were faced with the same scenario in Comoros,” said Mwendwa during the team’s luncheon at Safari Park on Tuesday. FKF president Nick Mwendwa. [Jonah Onyango, Standard]

“Our government cannot allow us to leave here when we have positive cases. It is a question that Caf has to handle. I’m proposing to have neutral doctors and testing centres when we are going to an away match. I feel federations should not test their opponents. Comoros were here and we never had problems with them. My proposal is that Caf needs to have a neutral testing function body to test the players.”

“For instance, a player like Olunga had tested in Qatar. You cannot leave Qatar if you are positive. He has tested here in Nairobi twice and both were negative. We went to Togo with a private jet and our hotel was isolated, but I think those results were an afterthought because they picked the core of the team.”

Just like his president, Olunga who features for Qatar giants Al-Duhail, was disheartened to miss the match.

“Of course I’m gutted. I wasn’t able to represent my country but the most important thing is that the team won away after a long time. It shows that we have a great team mostly composed of local-based players. I believe everybody gave a good account of themselves and it is a good way to finish our group. I hope most of them will be considered for future assignments,” said Olunga.",Sports,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

The 2021/22 edition of the government-sponsored Safari Tour golf series is scheduled to tee-off in May, Kenya Open Golf Limited (KOGL) General Manager Vincent Wangombe has said.

“However, this will depend on many factors including the ongoing lockdown,” Wanyama told Standard Sports. “As per now, our tentative schedule is May,” he added.

The golf administrator says the circuit will be at least ten legged as opposed to nine which was held in the last edition that ended in February. KOGL is also in talks with Rwanda to host one of the legs.

“We will still head to Kampala, Uganda as we did last season. Rwanda is also very positive to take up one leg in the series,” Wangombe said.

The new season will be different in that KOGL will use the circuit to offer extensive training to junior golfers in the legs.

“KOGL has come up with an education schedule for the juniors and this will be executed during the series in conjunction with the Safari Tour management.

“The aim is to help sharpen the youngsters who we want to act as a bridge to the national team. They are the ones who will take over after the current crop of pros shall have exited the scene,” said Wangombe.

KOGL also plans to hold a full Pro-Am event in one of the legs where the amateurs will play alongside the pros.

Golf Park player, David Wakhu has already pleaded with President Uhuru Kenyatta to reconsider the ban on all sporting activities especially on golf.

He says many golfers depend on the game for survival and closing the courses will make them more poorer.

“We can still play the game but without our fans and spectators,” says Wakhu.

Wakhu was the only Kenyan player who made the cut at the Kenya Savannah Classic that ended at the par 71 Karen Golf and Country Club in Nairobi last Friday.

The latest suspension of all sporting activities by President Uhuru Kenyatta has thrown Kenyan volleyball fraternity into a muddle ahead of the forthcoming CAVB Africa Club Championship.

Six teams, led by the Kenya Volleyball Federation League (KVF) men’s defending champions- General Service Unit (GSU), debutantes Kenya Ports Authority (KPA), KCB, Kenya Pipeline and Kenya Prisons (men and women) were set to take part in the month-long event due in Sousse, Tunisia.

The two championships that will act as qualifiers to the 2021 FIVB World Club Cup Championship, will run from April 16-28 (men) and April 19-May 1, 2021, for the women’s edition.

But the much-expected return of KCB’s to the continental stage has been thrown into serious qualms following the Covid-19 second public Order by Uhuru last week.

The Bankers were hoping to better their 2010 Bronze medal in Vacoas-Pheonix, Mauritius, but with the team having suspended training, chances are they will not be traveling to Tunisia unless a solution is found.

“I can’t say that we are out of the event yet. We will know the true position in the next two to three weeks,” head coach Japheth Munala said, adding that: “We can’t train at the moment because of the directive by the president.”

KCB earned a ticket to Africa’s most prestigious inter-club competition after finishing second behind the league winner Kenya Prisons in the 2019 season.

No male Kenyan team has ever taken part at the world stage, though GSU coach Gideon Tarus is upbeat that the bad record could be improved in the next couple of years.

“One thing I’m sure about is that very soon a Kenyan club will win Club Championship and play at the World stage,” added Tarus who won the league in 2019 with GSU. Kenya Prison Women's Chemutai in KVF League match against Kenya Pipeline at Nyayo National Stadium. [Jonah Onyango, Standard]

Tarus, whose best performance with GSU at the continental stage was a fifth-place finish in 2007, is aiming at a medal bracket even as he builds on a team to conquer Africa in years to come.

“We have a young crop of players whom I believe have the potential of winning the elusive club championship in the next two to three years.”

The Paramilitary side have invented a new training technique with mandatory bubble training inside the GSU camp at Ruaraka.

“We are still waiting for the Ministry (of sports) to give direction, but as it stands, there are signs that we will be participating in the event. We are training without interacting with our families,” said Tarus whose best performance at the event still remains a quarter-final berth.

“We wanted to play a friendly with at least a local team, but that will not be possible under the prevailing circumstances. So my best ‘friendly’ will be to win the first match because I want to use it to gauge my players as I head into the next match. If I manage to grab a win in the first match then I can tell you that we’ll have a good tournament,” add the record league winning coach.

Ramos was an 86th-minute substitute in Spain's 3-1 win over Kosovo in a World Cup qualifier on Wednesday and said he picked up the injury in the post-game warm down.

The problem puts his participation in Tuesday's Champions League quarter-final first leg at home to Liverpool and the Clasico with visitors Barcelona on April 10 in serious doubt.

Kenyans might soon have one of their own to watch in the UEFA Champions League next season should Harambee Stars defender Joseph Okumu's much-talked-about move to Rangers materialise.

Okumu is heavily linked with the Scottish champions who will play in the 2021/2022 Champions League, next season.

Steven Gerard-coached Rangers are in the market for a defender to replace Filip Helander, who is now being linked with a move away to Aston Villa and Leicester City.

Should Rangers who are understood to be willing to pay Sh300 million sign the cheque, then Okumu could become the second Kenyan after Victor Wanyama to have featured in the Scottish League and the fourth to have played in the UEFA Champions League. Other Kenyan players who have featured at the European inter club competition are Denis Oliech and McDonald Mariga who broke the ice in 2010, with Inter Milan.

Wanyama played for Celtic between 2011 and 2013 before moving to English Premier League side Southampton on 11 July, 2013 - in a Kenyan transfer record fee of Sh1.2 billion (£12.5 million)

Spain pulled off a convincing 3-1 win at home to Kosovo in a World Cup qualifier on Wednesday although goalkeeper Unai Simon had a night to forget, committing a tremendous blunder far from his area to cost his side a goal.

Dani Olmo gave Spain a deserved lead in the 34th minute with a delicate chip to add to his stoppage-time winner against Georgia in their previous outing, while Ferran Torres fired in the second goal two minutes later.

Spain looked in total control as they dominated possession and played with purpose but they allowed Kosovo back into the game in the 70th minute when Simon lost the ball after rushing out of his box and Besar Halimi ruthlessly pounced and scored from a distance.

The home side promptly restored their two-goal cushion five minutes later though thanks to a header from Gerard Moreno and saw out the win to move top of Group B with seven points after three games.

Spain had faced plenty of criticism for their sluggish start to qualifying after a 1-1 draw at home to Greece and a scrappy 2-1 victory in Georgia, after which Luis Enrique said he was 'very worried' about his side's struggles to break down tight teams intent on defending.

Practically everything clicked into place on Wednesday though, as 18-year-old Pedri pulled the strings in midfield while Ferran and Olmo used their pace to help prise open Kosovo.

After Olmo's sumptuous chip had broken the deadlock, Pedri laid on the pass for Ferran to double Spain's lead with a darting run inside from the right before firing into the opposite corner of the net.

Belgium's second-string used the opportunity of a rare start to impress coach Roberto Martinez as they thumped Belarus 8-0 in their World Cup qualifier on Tuesday.

With Martinez warning players were under scrutiny for places in the Euro 2020 squad, Michy Batshuayi, Hans Vanaken (2), Leandro Trossard (2), Jeremy Doku, Denis Praet and Christian Benteke all scored as the likes of Kevin De Bruyne, Romelu Lukaku and Dries Mertens were given the night off.

It lifted Belgium to seven points from three games in Group E, while Belarus suffered a first defeat after starting with a 4-2 win over Estonia. Czech Republic are second on four points after a 1-0 loss to Wales who are level on three with Belarus.

Belgium, top of the FIFA rankings, were 4-0 up at halftime at Den Dreef as they inflicted Belarus' heaviest ever defeat.

Batshuayi lashed home the opener from a tight angle in the 14th minute, followed three minutes later by Vanenken’s first international goal as he poked home from close range.

Trossard opened his national team account with a powerful shot into the far corner in the 38th. Four minutes later a breakaway by Jeremy Doku was finished with aplomb by the young striker.

Praet made it 5-0 four minutes into the second half with a shot from outside the penalty area before substitute Benteke swivelled to slam home on the volley after long pass out of defence from Toby Alderweireld.

Saturday's Group A match in Belgrade ended in a 2-2 draw after Ronaldo's stoppage-time effort crossed the line before it was cleared by Serbia defender Stefan Mitrovic, who then blocked a goal-bound follow up from Bernardo Silva.

A furious Ronaldo walked off the pitch and threw the captain's armband on to the turf seconds before Dutch referee Danny Makkelie blew full time, having been booked for dissent after the officials failed to award the goal. There was no VAR in place to review the decision.

[AFP]

For a man who has the world at his feet, Asbel Kiprop is not your ordinary celebrity.

With an Olympic gold, three world championships titles, Africa title and the third-fastest time in 1,500m in history is no mean feat. He’s simply on the global prism.

And Standard Sports Fools' Day prank titled ‘Reprieve for Asbel as AIU withdraws suspension’ set tongues wagging across the global stage. The Fool's Day prank headline.

Asbel will complete his four-year doping ban on February 2, 2022 and longs to gun for a spot in the national team to World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon, in July next year –if Athletics Kenya will reverse its decision to bar athletes who have served doping bans from national teams.

Coaches, athletes, Athletics Kenya officials and fans called in to confirm the news that indeed Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) had pardoned Asbel. Social media too was awash with mixed reactions.

An athletics fan wrote: “Kenya’s Standard newspaper today reported that Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) has admitted to wrongly banning Asbel Kiprop, the 1,500m champ. They realized their mistake after reviewing Kiprop’s defense. Now how many more innocent athletes have been frozen by the Anti-Doping body?”

One Langát wrote: “Let’s hope it’s true. We want him in the Olympic team.”

Barnaba Korir, the Athletics Kenya executive member was equally surprised. “What’s this story I am reading? I have received several calls from far and wide….It’s interesting,” said Korir.

Asbel has come a long way. His father David Kebenei was fourth placed at the 1987 All Africa Games in 1,500m.

Asbel is the most talented middle distance runner ever on grass, with nearly all global 1,500 metres jewels safely tucked under his belt.

He has won the Olympic Games (2008) World, Inter-continental Championships (2010) and World Championships in Daegu, South Korea (2011), Moscow (2013) and Beijing (2015) 1,500m titles.

Despite coming from a golden household that has often shipped in the 1,500m bullion from foreign lands, however, Asbel is not done yet.

Asbel stands among Kenya’s 1,500m world greats, who have recorded impressive performances in 1,500m at the Olympics. They include Kipchoge Keino, in Mexico in 1968, Peter Rono (Seoul, Korea, 1988) and Noah Ng’eny (Sydney, Australia, 2000).",Sports,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/

Pearl Thusi, among many other South Africans, celebrated Grootboom’s achievement.

However, apparently according to a handful of netizens on Twitter, only some South Africans are worthy to speak about it online, and apparently, Pearl Thusi isn’t one of them. All types of shades were thrown online.

Pearl Thusi’s social media posts

On Wednesday, Thusi shared a series of photos on Instagram, saying “when you meet a Queen, a Hero, it takes nothing from you to drop to your knees to show respect”.

She thanked Grootboom for her “commitment to [her] language, [her] work and thus being a constant to so many of us in this ever changing world”. Thusi added:

“Representing South African women do beautifully to themselves. You are synonymous with intelligence in women not being separated with her cultural and national pride”.

The Instagram post contained seven slides, two of which showed Thusi kneeling before Grootboom as a sign of respect, and two more showing to the acclaimed South African women hugging.

Accused of ‘being drama’

Unfortunately, not everyone took Thusi’s message in the positive light it was shared, with one Twitter user saying she was “being dramatic as always”, while another added, “Pearl Thusi, main character syndrome.”

A third commented: “Fede I saw that she’s an artist now… She’s pulling a young Rebecca there… New music video alert? Maybe. Hotel? Trivago”. Another simply said: “Drama too much that one”.

Another commented: “Queens lift Queens”

To Pearl Thusi’s defence

Some user, however, appreciated Thusi’s show of respect, with one user known as “Just Namhla” posting on Instagram: “Great message, I think the whole country feels exactly the same way, I know do.”

On Twitter, Warren said, “wow respect to Pearl Thusi, even with all her money, she still has respect for her elders… Big up Pearlito.” Meanwhile, Lungelo said everyone was “getting pressed for now reason”. One netizen summed it up succinctly:

“So it was all sad when everyone was crying last night, but when Pearl Thusi does it issa problem?”",Arts/Culture/Celebrities,https://www.thesouthafrican.com/

What’s more, the Rehab singer’s mother, Janis Winehouse, is set to give her perspective of her daughter’s life as she wanted to share her memories of her daughter in case there comes a time when she can’t remember anything due to multiple sclerosis, which can impact the ability to process information and memory loss.

Mother to provide ‘deeper insight into the real Amy’

A press release states: “Janis lives with multiple sclerosis, a condition which threatens to strip her of her memories of Amy, and is a large part of her motivation to make this timely and personal documentary.”

Janis said: “I don’t feel the world knew the true Amy, the one that I brought up, and I’m looking forward to the opportunity to offer an understanding of her roots and a deeper insight into the real Amy.”

‘Amy Winehouse: 10 Years On’: Celebratory and intimate

Commissioning editors Max Gogarty and Rachel Davies added: “‘Amy Winehouse: 10 Years On’ promises to be a celebratory and intimate portrayal of one of the brightest musical talents the UK has ever seen.

“While being a celebration of her musical genius and featuring rare and unheard performances, it will also offer a reinterpretation of the prevailing narrative around her rise and fall, told by those closest to her.”

Series of special BBC productions

The BBC is set to celebrate the Grammy winner’s life with a series of special productions, including a documentary on BBC Radio 2 about Amy’s influence on female musicians and a look back at her greatest live performances on BBC Radio 1.

The BBC documentary comes six years after the film Amy, which the singer’s father, Mitch Winehouse, had claimed presented him and his daughter in a “misleading” light.

The fourth instalment in the Marvel franchise – the follow-up to 2017’s critically-acclaimed Thor: Ragnarok – is also set to feature the likes of Matt Damon, Sam Neill and Luke Hemsworth as Asgardian actors playing Loki, Odin and Thor, respectively.

It was also revealed earlier this month that Melissa McCarthy is to play a fake version of Cate Blanchett’s villain Hela, with the tradition of telling Thor stories through amateur plays continuing in the upcoming motion picture.

While Christian Bale is to play Gorr the God Butcher and Chris Pratt will reprise his ‘Guardians of the Galaxy’ role of Star-Lord in Taika Waititi’s Marvel Cinematic Universe movie.

Meanwhile, the director previously hinted that sparks could fly between Hemsworth and Portman’s characters by stating that the film is “very romantic”.

He said: “I think it’s going to be really good. We’ve been writing the script off and on for a year and I’m just, actually this week, doing another pass on it.

“It is so insane and it’s also very romantic. I’m into romances now. I want to make romance. I want to make something that I’ve never done or cared for. I would like to attack something like that.”

Recently, Miley Cyrus revealed that the Crocodile Rock hitmaker tinkles the ivories on her rendition of the heavy metal titans’ 1991 classic Nothing Else Matters and now the man himself has teased that he’s worked on a Metallica-related project, seemingly the same one.

Speaking to SG Lewis on his Apple Music show Rocket Hour, the 74-year-old music legend said: “I’ve just done something with Metallica. During this lockdown period. I’ve been working with Gorillaz and people like that.

Hi this is 2D from Gorillaz. Thank you for being so generous to us, Mr Elton Sir John, with your time and genius and also those Danish pastries you brought and for making some of the best tunes of all time. https://t.co/Krf8WlPJT5 — gorillaz (@gorillaz) October 1, 2020

“I haven’t been doing any Elton stuff, but I’ve been doing great stuff with other people. So I’ll get you my email, email me and let’s get together and do something, okay?”

Miley Cyrus: From Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer to Yo-Yo Ma

The Midnight Sky hitmaker’s covers album also features Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith and 18-time Grammy-winning cellist Yo-Yo Ma.

She spilled last year: “I did a Metallica cover of ‘Nothing Else Matters’ featuring Elton John on the piano. I’ve got Yo-Yo Ma, Chad Smith. So many all-stars [are] in this band.

“I’m so excited about this collaboration. I’m really stoked. I love when ingredients don’t quite fit.”

Miley performed a version of Nothing Else Matters at the Glastonbury festival in 2019.

‘Totally ignited’

The Prisoner hitmaker first announced the project back in October.

She said: “We’ve been working on a Metallica covers album and I’m here working on that.

“We’re so lucky to be able to continue to work on our art during all of this [the coronavirus pandemic]. At first, it felt uninspiring and now I’ve been totally ignited.”

James Hetfield and co’s music also inspired the 28-year-old star’s latest album, Plastic Hearts.

She said previously: “In my [live] sets, I cover Britney Spears to Metallica, so my record will be reflective of who I am, which is just kind of all different pieces of inspiration and influence.”

He told The Daily Beast: “I know Johnny was writing all last year, when that whole thing was going on with him.

“But you know, that’s not going to stop him from going home and writing. In fact, it probably helped. I’m expecting some pretty interesting songs.”

Johnny Depp ready to get back on tour with Hollywood Vampires

Johnny – who has a separate libel dispute pending trial in the US — doesn’t want the dramas in his personal life to interfere with life in the band and is ready to get back on tour with the group.

Alice said: “There’s no drama.

“[Johnny] said, ‘Hey, that’s another world. That has nothing to do with what I’m doing in the band.’ He’s like, ‘I can’t wait to get back onstage.’ He’s one of my best buddies.”

‘Three alpha males’

The supergroup — which was founded in 2015 by Cooper, Depp and Aerosmith’s Joe Perry — can’t wait to get back together again.

Alice gushed: “It’ll be great when we all get together. You know, the crazy thing about that band is you’ve got eight guys in the band, and you’ve got three alpha males leading it, but there’s never been one argument. Nobody’s ever even raised their voice to anybody in that band. It’s really cool.”

UK/European tour rescheduled

The band had been due to tour Europe this summer, but recently announced they were cancelling the gigs due to “the uncertainty of COVID-19 travel restrictions”.

They said in a statement: “We are beyond disappointed to announce that the Hollywood Vampires must cancel our rescheduled UK/European tour this Summer.

“I tell you what, I could actually spank Eminem,” wrote Nasty C in a tweet.

“The reason why I say this is because recently Eminem is not really relatable, he is dope, his bars are out of this world but he is not relatable.

“If you are a rapper you go crazy over it, if you are a normal person you get to the end of the verse and ask ‘what did he just say’.

“I could do both, I could totally make no sense to a normal person or I could be super relatable, so I could spank Eminem.”

Nasty C backtracks: ‘I love Eminem’

According to TeamTalk, some were admiring of Nasty C’s self-belief but mostly he was mocked for the claim as he is never likely to reach the heights Eminem has in his career.

Following the backlash he received, the Zulu Man With Some Power hitmaker cleared the air saying he loved Eminem.

“Dear Eminem. I love you. If you see the video going around don’t pay no mind to it. Just laugh about it and move on. Ngyak’saba,” he wrote in an Insta Story.

‘Spencer’: One weekend in the life of Princess Diana

Spencer — which also stars Timothy Spall, Sally Hawkins, and Sean Harris — focuses on one weekend in the life of Princess Diana in 1991, as she spends the Christmas holiday with the royal family at the Sandringham estate in Norfolk, and decides to leave her marriage to Prince Charles.

The film was written by Steven Knight, and is being produced by Juan de Dios Larraín for Fabula Films, Jonas Dornbach and Janine Jackowski for Komplizen Film, and Paul Webster for Shoebox Films.

Kristen Stewart to star as Princess Diana

The producers previously said in a joint statement: “We are extremely grateful for the support of our distributors worldwide, our partners and funders who have shown tremendous commitment to us in these extraordinary times.

“With Kristen Stewart, Steven Knight and the rest of our fantastic team both in front and behind the camera we are bringing ‘Spencer’ to the world. It is an independently produced film made for the big screen about an iconic woman’s own declaration of independence. We couldn’t be more excited!”

Executive producers are Tom Quinn, Jeff Deutchman and Christina Zisa for NEON and Michael Bloom, Maria Zuckerman and Ryan Heller for Topic Studios.

Charles and Diana separated in 1992 after 11 years of marriage and divorced in 1996. The following year, the princess — who had sons Princes William and Harry with her ex-husband — died in a car crash in Paris, France.

The NFT craze

NFTs (non-fungible token) are an emerging market within blockchain where single-impression unique digital art and goods, known as the “token” can be sold.

Stars, including Kings of Leon, Gorillaz, Banksy and Elon Musk, have all recently sold NFTs.

However, it is unclear if The Weeknd’s new song will be sold as an NFT or if it will be called ‘Living in NFT space’.

The Weeknd vs ‘corrupt’ Grammys

Meanwhile, The Weeknd recently revealed that he won’t have anything to do with the Grammys in the future, after previously calling the awards “corrupt”.

He said: “Because of the secret committees I will no longer allow my label to submit my music to the Grammys.”

And he previously said: “The Grammys remain corrupt. You owe me, my fans and the industry transparency…”

R&B crooner who rose to fame from his 2011 nine-song mixtape, House of Balloons. He’s solidified his star status thanks to his blockbuster albums Beauty Behind the Madness (2015) — which included his biggest hits to date, “The Hills” and “Can’t Feel My Face” — and Starboy (2016).

Brad Pitt did ‘95% of his own physical stunts’

Greg told Vulture: “Brad did 95% of his physical stunts — the fighting. He’s like a natural-born athlete. He really got in there! Never have I ever done so many huge actors in one feature where all of them excelled at the physical movement of our training. So Brad, Brian [Tyree Henry], Michael Shannon, Hiroyuki Sonada, Andrew Koji — who was already a stud in terms of where he comes from with the show ‘Warrior’ — all these actors put out some great action and did a lot of stuff.”‘

Fight Club star Brad, 57, won an Oscar for his portrayal of stunt man Cliff Booth in Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon A Time In Hollywood’last year.

Five assassins on a bullet train…

Deadline sums up the plot of Bullet Train as follows:

WATCH: MILA KUNIS IN ‘FOUR GOOD DAYS’

The trailer for the film has already raked in more than 2.8 million views.

ABOUT ‘FOUR GOOD DAYS’

Four Good Days is centred around Molly, played by Mila Kunis who is a woman struggling with her drug addiction. She is told that she needs to stay clean for four more days in order to receive an opiate antagonist shot which makes the body immune to being high so she can stay clean.

Her estranged mother, played by eight-time Oscar nominee Glenn Close, supports her through the journey.

“Despite all she has learnt over a decade of disappointment, grief and rage, Deb throws herself into one last attempt to save her beloved daughter from the deadly and merciless grip of heroin addiction,” described by Collider.

“Now reunited, they work to regain the love and trust that once held them together,” added Collider.

The film is a rollercoaster of emotions as Molly attempts to fight her withdrawal symptoms and has to face everything that her addiction has cost her, such as the trust of her parents and the custody of her children.

BASED ON A TRUE STORY

The film is based on the true story of Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington Post writer Eli Saslow’s article “How’s Amanda?’ A story of truth, lies and an American addiction”. The film made its debut at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival where it was well received by critics.

The film is set to be released by Vertical Entertainment in theatres on 30 April 2021.

Mila Kunis is best known for her light-hearted comedy roles starting back at That 70’s Show moving up to Bad Moms, last month it was announced that the actress will be starring in Netflix’s adaptation of Luckiest Girl Alive which she will also serve as a producer on.

The film is based on Jessica Knoll’s novel with the same name and follows a woman who is trying to outrun a high school tragedy that had changed her life.

“This has been six years of relentless rewriting, rejections, studio changes, and torturous stretches of stagnation,” wrote Knoll in an Instagram post.

“I am SO proud of the fact that Mila Kunis read the 63rd draft of my script and was like yeah, I get this girl, and so grateful for her shrewd third act notes that helped me take the 64th draft into another stratosphere,” she added.

Elsewhere, Chloe X Halle landed two awards for Outstanding Duo, Group or Collaboration (Traditional) and ‘Do It’ won the pair Outstanding Soul/R&B Song, the latter of which Beyonce’s Black Parade was nominated for.

Other winners included Doja Cat, who was named Outstanding New Artist, Drake took home Outstanding Male Artist and Jhene Aiko’s Chilombo was honoured with the Outstanding Album accolade.

AKA expressed his reservations about Rollins current feud with the Master of Strong Style, Shinsuke Nakumura but the Supa Mega might have erred in tagging the Triple Crown Champion in his tweet.

AKA said he hoped Rollins would do better than his opponent Shinsuke Nakamura and not get stuck in his level. To which Rollins responded that he’s definitely better than AKA in the ring. AKA’s last line of defense was his style, letting Seth Rollins know his cowboy boots put both Rollins and Nakamura to shame. Rollins, who is known for his lowkey flamboyant WWE looks, conceded that he might need to borrow the boots from AKA.

I’M A GD MAIN EVENT NO MATTER WHO I’M BEATING!!!! NAKAMURA IS ONE OF THE BEST IN THE WORLD TO BOOT! NOT AS GOOD AS ME, BUT A HELLUVA LOT BETTER THAN YOU! — Seth Rollins (@WWERollins) March 22, 2021

AKA and the WWE

AKA is no stranger to the WWE having made an appearance in the ring during one of the companies tours to South Africa in 2018.

At that time the rapper ran afoul of the WWE’s resident musician, Elias before being helped out by the monster among men Braun Strowman.

AKA is known to be a big fan of the WWE but might not have expected the ‘Messiah’ to respond to his concerns.

Rollins is not one to shy away from clapping back at his critics whether they are fans, journalists or hip-hop sensations.

AKA might have a point regarding the direction of the Seth Rollins character. Rollins is the only wrestler to have held all three of the WWE brands top belts (WWE, Universal, and NXT Championships) but hasn’t been featured in a main event programme since the lacklustre end to his feud with Bray Wyatt in 2019.

What is in store for Rollins at WrestleMania 37

Rollins was involved in one of the most iconic moments of WWE Wrestlemania history when he bolted to the ring during Brock Lesnar’s WWE World Heavyweight Championship match against Roman Reigns, and eventually claimed the title.

The former champ was left off the poster and promotional images for this year’s event but Rollins was quick to come back with a retort, claiming that he does feature, inside the eye of a skull on the images.",Arts/Culture/Celebrities,https://www.thesouthafrican.com/

Belair and Banks’ match will be the first time two black women challenge each other in a world-title match at WWE’s flagship event, WrestleMania.

Bianca Belair and Sasha Banks’ to make WrestleMania history

Belair earned the opportunity to fight any champion of her choosing at WrestleMania after staying a record 56 minutes in the ring fighting for her Royal Rumble win. She mentioned that she chose Banks as her opponent because of what it would mean for representation.

“Two Afro-females, black Afro-females. What it represents is really sending a powerful message to the world. She motivates me. I see everything she’s doing, and I’m happy for her, but I wanna do it, too.

“I’m going to WrestleMania to create history, but I’m also going there to become a Champion. That’s what I’m going to do. I’m going to show everybody that I am the strongest, and the fastest, the roughest, the toughest, the quickest, the greatest, that I’m the B-E-S-T since Sasha wants to call herself the best. When it’s all said and done, and I’m standing there raising the title over my head, the proof will be that I am exactly what I say I am. I’m the EST of WWE,” said Belair after announcing Banks as her choice of opponent at Smackdown.

Sasha Banks looks to enhance her legacy at Wrestlemania

A trailblazer in WWE, five-time RAW women’s champion Sasha Banks is a Grand Slam winner with a long list of firsts.

Banks wrestled in WWE’s first Iron Woman match, the first women’s Hell in A Cell and won the first ever Women’s Tag-team Championship with Bayley. Banks was also one of the first women to headline a WWE Pay-per-view with Charlotte Flair in 2016. In 2020, she was named Sports Illustrated’s Wrestler of the Year.

Having been one of the leaders of a groundbreaking era for Women in WWE, along with the other members of the Four Horsewomen, Banks helped pioneer the future for women in the business. Due to their strides and impact, Superstars like Bianca have a greater platform to showcase their abilities and a chance to earn more championships.

The upstart looking to make her mark

Belair has been a rising star in WWE since she joined NXT in 2016. Soon after being drafted into Smackdown in October 2020, she qualified for the women’s Survivor series after defeating Billie Kay and Natalya in a triple threat match. She did sterling work accompanying the Street Profits but has stepped out of their shadow to establish herself as one of the draws of the women’s division.

Her Royal Rumble win made her the second-ever African American Superstar to reach this feat in WWE history after The Rock.

Since Belair’s Royal Rumble win, the two women have worked together as partners in a feud against Women’s Tag Team Champions Nia Jax and Shayna Baszler. The two initially lost at Elimination Chamber and remained strong as a unit, but a second loss at Fastlane ended with Banks slapping Belair and calling her a rookie.

It remains to be seen if this bad blood will be long lasting, as we’ve seen throughout WWE history, it doesn’t take much for Superstars to betray each other when there’s a title on the line.

Living in a world of pink

According to reports, Bruna Carolina Peres, who lives in the state of Paranà in southern Brazil, claims to have always been in love with pink – and wanted to become a real-life Barbie during her teenage years. It is said that Bruna was not a big fan of Barbie dolls as a child, but got the nickname after sporting long blonde hair and her clear fascination with the colour pink.

Not that it bothered her, on the contrary: she adopted the lifestyle of a real human Barbie, and collected gadgets and clothes related to the famous doll. And so, growing up, this human Barbie has not only chosen to always dress in pink, all of her furniture, and accessories in the house, are also pink!

Bruna Barbie’s ‘dream house’

Today writes that 97% of the clothes in her wardrobe are pink, with only a few black or white variations.

And as for the house, Bruna spent about $92 000 (R1 378 795,72) to adapt her villa to fit the ‘Barbie lifestyle’ where everything from the walls to the pool is pink.

“I started posting photos and videos that showed my lifestyle,” Bruna told Jb Litoral. “My audience is very diverse, there are those who share my love for pink, and then there are those who do not, but appreciate my determination and personality. 90% of my followers are women aged 18 to 34 “.

She said that the whole persona became her profession when people started to notice her on social media.

Lost is the first release from Knight’s debut EP, Limbo.

THE SOUTH AFRICAN CATCHES UP WITH BRADLEY KNIGHT

Fame is about?

Fame offers a platform to potentially influence a significant audience with one’s philosophies.

Retirement will happen when?

Never. The Japanese philosophy of finding your “ikigai” and “working” at it until the end of your days appeals to me.

Ikigai means “a reason for being”.

I don’t do…

Superficial.

What does music mean to you?

Music is a way to explore and unlock the deepest and most mysterious aspects of my inner self and the external world around me.

My music is about…

Whatever I am experiencing at that time. I want to keep it honest, transparent and progressive- like one would a private journal.

I would love to co-write with…

Billie Eilish and her brother, Finneas.

Where do you go for inspiration to create?

As far away from my thoughts as possible.

What is the most enjoyable aspect of your work?

Sitting down and playing until that moment happens. That moment of inspiration that grips you and renders you as nothing more than a blissful conduit.

My heroes?

Frank Ocean and Billie Eilish are my current inspirations.

In this file photo, Billie Eilish and Finneas O’Connell, winners of Record of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical, pose in the press room during the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards at Staples Center on 26 January 2020 in Los Angeles, California.

Which living person(s) do you admire most and why?

Billie Eilish and Finneas. Their story is undeniably human.

What is your most treasured possession?

My signet rings.

It’s your round. What are you drinking?

This year…chamomile tea.

Dream gig to do?

Red Rocks venue in Colorado.

What makes you stand out?

I’m writing music that is unique to my story and emotions. The way I see it: When you are approaching music from a soulful position rather than trying to write hits, there will always be a space to stand out. There is only ever one you.

If you were not a musician what would you do?

Psychology. Humans fascinate me.

Who would play you in a Hollywood blockbuster?

Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson.

Pick five words to describe yourself?

Creative, curious, warm, soulful, passionate.

Schindler’s List.

An orbital joy ride on a Space X shuttle.

Your greatest achievement?

Singing at the headquarters of the United Nations in New York.

What do you complain about most often?

Society. The Dalai Lama stated it elegantly when he was asked about what surprises him most about humanity: “Man. Because he sacrifices his health in order to make money, then he sacrifices money to recuperate his health. And then he is so anxious about the future that he does not enjoy the present; the result being that he does not live in the present or the future; he lives as if he is never going to die and dies having never really lived”

What is your fear?

My biggest fear is regret.

Happiness is?

Gratitude and finding joy in the smallest things.

On stage I tend to?

Get caught up and lost in the moment.

The best life lesson you have been taught?

Remain adaptable, curious and open-minded.

Do you get worked up while watching a sports game on TV?

Overly. I’m a huge football fan.

Where would you like to be right now?

Japan. Learning about different cultures and ways of life

Do you do charity work and if you do –what do you do?

I am a part of the DUKKS Foundation. In 2017, my cousin, Daniel, was murdered trying to defend two girls from being mugged on Kloof Street, in Cape Town.

Our family started DUKKS soon after with the intention of helping charity institutions optimise their efforts by offering support in various ways.

One being that DUKKS helps reduce running costs of the organisation’s facilities, such as electricity and water, by installing energy-efficient solutions for them.

It’s a holistic approach to charity, with the aim to help as many charities as possible.

Wishes and dreams?

Russell Crowe: ‘Unhinged’ an accurate portrayal of world’s anger

Crowe recently starred in the action thriller Unhinged as a man who becomes hell-bent on revenge when a woman honks her horn at him while driving and he felt the film was an accurate portrayal of the anger that can be seen across the world.

The 56-year-old actor said: “I started to realise this type of rage is happening continuously all over the place, that seems to be a place we’ve arrived at in Western society.",Arts/Culture/Celebrities,https://www.thesouthafrican.com/
https://www.thesouthafrican.com/lifestyle/entertainment/kevin-bacon-goat-songs-creep-instagram-watch/,Gruff stuff: Kevin Bacon kids around with songs for wife’s pet goats [watch],"City on a Hill actor Kevin Bacon marked 32 years of marriage to Kyra Sedgwick by presenting the actress with the animals for their anniversary, but he’s recently become an Instagram sensation thanks to his videos of him singing to the creatures.

And Bacon, who rose to stardom in 1984 with Footloose, admitted he had “no idea” the clips would be so popular as he only began them for his own pleasure.

‘Very relaxing hanging out with goats’ – Kevin Bacon

He told Entertainment Tonight: “Goat Songs is immensely popular and I had no idea it would be.

“During the pandemic there have been some impulsive moves and mine was to get some tiny miniature goats for Kyra as an anniversary present. And I kind of discovered…that I find it very relaxing hanging out with them. Sometimes I’ll go down and bring an instrument and they don’t hate it.

Song requests streaming in

“So I started playing songs and then I said, ‘Well I’ll just play songs to the goats’. And then someone came up with the idea of actually asking people if they had any suggestion for the songs the goats might like, and people made silly jokes like, ‘You can goat your own way’ or one of them was, ‘You gotta do some New Kids on the Block’.”

Last month, Kevin responded to the boy band request and played NKOTB’s Hanging Tough to his goats on his guitar, prompting a request from Backstreet Boys singer AJ McLean.

He recalled: “So I did a New Kids on the Block song and I got a message on Instagram from AJ from the Backstreet Boys who said, ‘You gotta do a Backstreet Boys song if you’re going to do a New Kids song.’

Backstreet Boys for the alpacas

“So that was the latest one we put up was a song with the Backstreet Boys. It was with me and our alpacas in this case, the menagerie sort of expanded and goats.”

Edgier musical taste: Radiohead’s ‘Creep’

As promised, Kevin sang I Want It That Way to his alpacas earlier this week and perhaps he chose not to subject the goats to the track because they seem to have edgier musical taste as the 62-year-old star revealed they have enjoyed Creep by Radiohead more than any of his other covers.

He said: “The funny thing is, there’s that weird sort of like guitar thing…I only have my acoustic [guitar]. In the Radiohead song it’s like a big huge electric thing, and I did like a (sound) and both the goats were like, what? And one of them ran, the other one turned and was like, ‘What was that?’

In the first two episodes of her YouTube documentary series, Losing Control: Dancing with the Devil, which aired on Tuesday 23 March, Lovato spoke about how she “went to town”, mixing meth with ecstacy, cocaine, weed, alcohol and oxycontin before her 2018 drug overdose.

‘SHOPPING SPREE’ FOR DRUGS

In Losing Control: Dancing with the Devil, Lovato describes her drug use before her overdose as a “shopping spree”.

“I just so happened to run into my old drug dealer from six years before and like the odds of that happening was crazy and he had like a duffel bag and I just went to town. I just went on a shopping spree. “That night I did drugs that I’d never done before. I’d never done meth before, I tried meth, I mixed it with molly [ecstacy], with coke, weed, alcohol, oxycontin and that alone should have killed me,” she added.

‘MINUTES AWAY FROM DEATH’

In Episode Two, Lovato and her friends provide a first-hand perspective of the aftermath of the overdose as she woke up in the hospital, being minutes away from death.

The Camp Rock star also opened up about being taken advantage of sexually by her dealer.

“When they found me, I was naked, I was blue. I was literally left for dead after he took advantage of me,” said Lovato. “And when I woke up in the hospital, they asked if I had had consensual sex and there was one flash that I had of him on top of me. I saw that flash and I said yes,” said Lovato.

She later realised that she was in no state of mind to have given her consent.

I’m really excited to have @marenmorris singing background vocals on this song!! Produced by Aaron Dessner and co-written by Scooter Carusoe – can’t wait for you to hear it (sic)”

Halle Berry to take lead with Wahlberg

According to Collider, Berry will take the lead with Wahlberg, who is also serving as producer with his longtime collaborator Steph Levinson.

As it stands, the project still doesn’t have a confirmed director, although the report notes that the streaming platform could already have its eye on someone without finalising a deal yet.

‘Our Man in Jersey’ to be filmed in London

And as reported by Deadline, the movie – despite its New Jersey setting – will actually be filmed in London early in 2022.

Although plot details are being kept secret for now, the upcoming blockbuster has been described as a spy movie akin to the ‘James Bond’ franchise with a “blue-collar lead”.

Halle Berry also starring in ‘Bruised’, ‘Mothership’

This isn’t the first Netflix project Berry has signed up for, as the company recently acquired her directorial debut Bruised (in which Berry also plays the lead role), which will be released later this year.

She has also signed up to star in upcoming sci-fi movie The Mothership.

The story follows Sara Morse (Berry) a year after her husband mysteriously vanished from their rural farm. But when she discovers a strange, extra-terrestrial object underneath their home, Sara and her kids set off on a race to find their husband, father and most importantly, the truth.

Oscar-nominated screenwriter Matthew Charman will make his feature directorial debut and has also written the script.

Fred Berger and Brian Kavanaugh-Jones are producing the film under their Automatik banner. Danny Stillman will serve as an executive producer alongside Berry .

Bond girl Jinx Johnson

She previously played Bond girl Jinx Johnson in the 2002 007 film Die Another Day and claimed that studios were too scared to make a spin-off based on the NSA agent, with MGM put off by the $80 million (R1.2 billion) price tag – despite Bond bosses Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson lobbying for her to get her own movie.

She said: “It was very disappointing.

“It was ahead of its time. Nobody was ready to sink that kind of money into a black female action star. They just weren’t sure of its value. That’s where we were then.”

He headlined WrestleMania III, where he successfully defended the WWE Championship against Andre The Giant in front of a record 93,173 fans at the Pontiac Silverdome. Hogan went on to win six WWE Championships, starred in movies, television shows and became an idol to a vast legion of fans he dubbed “Hulkamaniacs.” He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2005 by Hollywood legend Sylvester Stallone, and this year will become a two-time Hall of Fame inductee as nWo®, one of sports entertainment’s most notorious factions, is enshrined.

O’Neil is a Tampa Bay native and graduated from the University of Florida where he was a standout football player for the Gators.

Daniel Radcliffe joins star cast of Sandra Bullock, Channing Tatum

The plot centres on a reclusive romance novelist (Bullock), who was sure nothing could be worse than getting stuck on a book tour with her cover model (Tatum), until a kidnapping attempt sweeps the pair into a cut-throat adventure in the jungle — proving life can be so much stranger, as well as more romantic, than any of her stories.

Adam and Aaron Nee are directing the movie from a script penned by Dana Fox. Sandra will produce the film for her Fortis Films banner, with Liza Chasin and Seth Gordon also producing for 3dot Productions and Exhibit A respectively.

Daniel shot to fame as a child actor after playing the title role in the Harry Potter franchise and previously explained that one of his biggest fears is not being able to work on films anymore.

All for the love of acting

Asked what he’s afraid of, he admitted: “Lots of things. But the biggest fear for me other than, obviously, something dreadful happening to my loved ones, or to my physical health, steps from a fear of: ‘What if I don’t get to be on film sets in some capacity for the rest of my life?’

“If something were to happen that took that away from me, that would be the worst.”

Daniel added that he feels “incredibly lucky” to be doing a job he loves in the form of acting.

He said: “I feel incredibly lucky. It is a cliché to say that acting is an amazing job, but to have a career where you have some say over what you want to do, it puts you in a very small percentage within the acting world.

“So I am ridiculously lucky and try not to forget this.”

https://www.thesouthafrican.com/lifestyle/entertainment/fugard-theatre-closes-what-went-wrong/,Demise of South Africa’s Fugard Theatre points to systemic failures,"South Africa’s theatre fraternity reacted with heartbreak to the announcement earlier in March that Cape Town’s beloved Fugard Theatre was closing for good. Named after famous South African playwright Athol Fugard, the theatre was established in 2010. Since then, it has produced many landmark productions, among them King Kong (2017) and Kat and the Kings (2012).

Actress and academic Fiona Ramsay asked playwright and and seasoned theatre and arts festival manager Ismail Mahomed about the forces that had aligned to see the theatre close – and whether this could have been prevented.

What does the demise of the Fugard Theatre mean?

The closing down of the theatre means far more than just the loss of one more place where artists, technicians and arts administrators could have earned a living. The Fugard Theatre rose like a phoenix in democratic South Africa. It was located in an area that had once been demolished by apartheid’s bulldozers during the destruction of the mixed-race suburb District Six as a result of the Group Areas Act of 1950.

Table Mountain shadowed the Fugard, located almost behind the Cape Town City Hall where Nelson Mandela made his inaugural speech after his release from prison.

It symbolised what was possible in South Africa – the return to our roots and the reclamation of our histories. The Fugard Theatre gave us the freedom to envision the now and the future.

What is the Fugard Theatre’s legacy?

One of the most poignant lines ever to have been spoken on the stages of the theatre was by Athol Fugard. At the opening of the Fugard Theatre he said: “We are sitting on the laps of ghosts.”

It was a fairly eerie thought but it meant more than just sitting on the laps of the ghosts of the people who lived in District Six.

We were sitting on the laps of Barney Simon, Ramaloa Makhene, Doris Sihula, Matsemela Manaka, Mavis Taylor, Lucille Gillwald and all those deceased artists who had used their creative voices to fight apartheid and censorship through theatre; and whose spirit had come to rejoice in the birth of a new post-apartheid mainstream, independent, free-thinking theatre.

To what extent was COVID-19 to blame?

COVID-19 restrictions severely impacted theatres and there were several initiatives launched at the commencement of the national lockdown to provide artists with immediate relief both financially and materially.

The growing crisis in the performing arts sector has been caused by the Department of Sport, Arts and Culture’s lack of vision and strategy and minimal understanding about the sector; and hence the artist relief fund offers little hope for the rebirth of an industry after the lockdown.

How does this point to bigger problems?

Since 1994, the government has failed at developing a well-structured arts and culture department. The sector has been endowed with one embarrassing arts minister after the next. Performing arts institutions have become agencies of “official art” that is often anti-intellectual.

Once a hub of free thinking and progressive political engagement, the Market Theatre Foundation is a shadow of its former self. This is mainly because more than 90% of the subsidy it receives from the department is channelled into exorbitant salaries, operations and council [board] costs. There’s very little left for the creation of work by artists.

The Market Theatre’s lowest moment in its 44-year history was when its senior executives had to blow the whistle and invoke the Protective Disclosures Act against its governing council, appointed and defended by the arts minister.

A white paper on arts, culture and heritage has been under revision since 2015. It is still far from being implemented. The Living Legend project, initiated by the department to honour artists over the age of 70 has lost millions through fraud. R20m was stolen from the State Theatre in Pretoria by some of its employees.

Against this background independent artists have been fighting to be recognised, respected and be supported.

Has state intervention helped or hindered theatres?

The Fugard Theatre received no support from the department of arts and culture. Even when it began to sound alarm bells last year that it would be mothballing there was no support from local, provincial or national government.

While the closure of The Fugard Theatre is an indictment on the department for failing to see its national relevance, it is an equal indictment on the provincial and local governments that failed to see the importance of this theatre in boosting the local economy and cultural tourism.

The theatre survived on the generosity of a single philanthropist, Eric Abraham, and its loyal supporters. This offered an opportunity to build a meaningful partnership for the sustainability of the theatre. But the powers that be apparently saw no value in building a public-private partnership.

What role would the Fugard Theatre have played in future?

The demise of the theatre shocked many theatre lovers. Image: The Fugard Theatre

The Fugard Theatre, in the south of the country, was a counter-balance to the Market Theatre in Johannesburg. Both theatres were founded as independent institutions. Both were founded by visionaries. Both were located in parts of the city that were being revitalised. Both attracted diverse audiences with unique South African stories.

After the lockdown, the Market will survive in the shadow of its former reputation, but now supported by a department whose reputation is tainted.

The Fugard Theatre, unfortunately, will return to the ashes, locked, bolted and silenced. It will be a monument to how a failed department could not match public philanthropy.

The department could not support the theatre to reclaim its histories and enable its patrons to return to their roots so that they could find healing. Yet social cohesion is a core mandate of the department. Furthermore, the marginalisation of the independent theatre sector in South Africa raises questions about the department’s commitment to the constitutional values of freedom of speech and freedom of creativity.

https://www.thesouthafrican.com/lifestyle/entertainment/shes-all-that-gender-swapped-remake-hes-all-that-netflix/,‘She’s All That’ gender-swapped remake is heading to Netflix,"Netflix is developing a gender-swapped reboot of 1999’s romantic comedy She’s All That. The remake will star TikTok sensation-turned-actress Addison Rae, Cobra Kai’s Tanner Buchanan, and original star Rachael Leigh Cook in a brand new role.

She’s All That was essentially a modern-day adaptation of George Bernard Shaw’s play Pygmalion and George Cukor’s 1964 film My Fair Lady. It starred Freddie Prinze Jr as a popular high school kid who turns an unpopular girl (Rachael Leigh Cook) into prom queen.

Although the movie received mixed reviews from critics, it was one of the most popular teen films of the ‘90s and reached the number one spot at the box office in its first week of release.

Remember ‘She’s All That’? Watch the trailer:

‘He’s All That’ from teenage girl’s point of view

He’s All That flips the original narrative and will be told from a teenage girl’s point of view. But the film’s main protagonist is still said to be inspired by Freddie Prinze Jr’s Zackary Siler.

The story follows influencer Padgett Sawyer (Rae) who, after suffering a humiliating breakup, accepts a challenge to turn the school’s least popular boy (Buchanan) into prom king.

The movie will also feature the acting talents of Madison Pettis, Peyton Meyer, Isabella Crovetti, Annie Jacob, Myra Molloy, and Matthew Lillard. Rachael Leigh Cook will star as Sawyer’s wise and caring mother.

He’s All That is directed by Mark Waters (of Mean Girls fame) from a script by Lee Fleming, the screenwriter behind the original film. Additionally, original She’s All That producers Jennifer Gigbot and Andrew Panay will serve as producers on the project alongside Bill Block for Miramax.

He’s All That will be released worldwide on Netflix later this year.

https://www.thesouthafrican.com/lifestyle/entertainment/oscars-academy-awards-in-person-event-2021/,Be there! Zooming into Oscars ‘not an option’ for nominees,"The ceremony will take place next month as an in-person event, with organisers opting to treat it as an “active movie set”, with various coronavirus measures in place, and in a letter sent out to those on the shortlists on Thursday 18 March, producers detailed the “great lengths” they were going to to stage a “safe and enjoyable” evening.

In the note sent to over 200 nominees, producers Steven Soderbergh, Jesse Collins and Stacey Sher acknowledged some may be uneasy about it being an in-person event at Los Angeles’ Union Station – albeit with “additional show elements live from the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood” — but sought to offer reassurance.

‘Active movie set’: Oscars will be in-person event

They wrote: “Of course, your first thought is CAN THAT BE DONE SAFELY? The answer is YES, IT CAN. We are treating the event as an active movie set, with specially designed testing cadences to ensure up-to-the-minute results, including an on-site COVID safety team with PCR testing capability.”

Guests attending from outside of Los Angeles will receive further “specific instructions”, which will vary from those already living in the city but those who are “unable to attend because of scheduling or continued uneasiness about travelling” were told “there will not be an option to Zoom in for the show”.

They added: “We are going to great lengths to provide a safe and ENJOYABLE evening for all of you in person, as well as for all the millions of film fans around the world, and we feel the virtual thing will diminish those efforts.”

The producers encouraged winners to make speeches “personal” but keep them short and expressed their hope the ceremony, which takes place on 25 April, will have a “feeling of casual exchange and good humour.”

Pre-show gathering before Oscars ceremony

And they want to set the tone with a “pre-show gathering” immediately before the ceremony.

They wrote: “The good news is you should be pretty relaxed by show time because you will have been at a pre-show gathering in the Union Station courtyard for the previous ninety minutes with your fellow nominees and their guests (ONLY nominees and their guests will be attending the show, by the way. Oh, and the presenters!).

Dress code: Strictly formal

The letter also touched on the night’s dress code, stressing casual attire would not be welcomed.

The note read: “You’re wondering about the Dress Code (as well you should). We’re aiming for a fusion of Inspirational and Aspirational, which in actual words means formal is totally cool if you want to go there, but casual is really not.”

In addition to having a smaller guest list this year, it was previously announced both the annual Oscar Nominees Luncheon, which takes place in the lead up to the ceremony, and the post-event Governor’s Ball have been cancelled for this year.

As the last pitstop before WrestleMania 37, Fastlane could have a huge influence on the match card at the ‘Show of Shows’.

The below titles are at risk as we approach Fastlane this weekend:

WWE Universal Championship Title Match

Daniel Bryan will challenge Roman Reigns for the Universal Championship Title. Bryan lost his opportunity at clinching the Championship belt after winning the brutal Elimination Chamber match this year only to be outdone by Reigns.

Bryan has much to prove having lost the first-ever Fastlane match against Reigns six years ago, while The Tribal Chief is keen to get Bryan out of the way to go head-to-head with Royal Rumble winner The Rated R Superstar, Edge, at WrestleMania.

The Intercontinental Title Match

The Intercontinental Champion Big E will be defend his title against Apollo Crews, who is more determined than ever to show Big E the “real” Apollo Crews.

Big E has openly declared Apollo Crews unfit to challenge him and even incurred a vicious steel step assault from Crews that led to him being wheeled out on a stretcher. On the 12 March edition of SmackDown, Big E gave Crews a shot at the title, and when Crews did not emerge, he went on to successfully defend his title against Sami Zayn.

Of course, moments after this victory, Apollo Crews announced to the WWE community that he would challenge for the Intercontinental Championship title at WWE Fastlane. This one has certainly been long-coming and we will finally see if Apollo Crews’ royal Nigerian ancestry truly makes him better than The Powerhouse of Positivity.

WWE Women’s Tag Team Championship

In the Women’s Tag Team Championship, SmackDown Women’s champion Sasha Banks will be teaming up with Women’s Royal Rumble 2021 winner Bianca Belair to go up against Nia Jax and Shayna Baszler. It remains to be seen if Banks and Belair will face each other at WrestleMania holding a tag team title together or if Jax and Baszler, who have just successfully defended their title against Dakota Kai and Raquel Gonzalez, will retain their title.

WWE FASTLANE 2021 PPV will take place this Sunday, the 21st of March, at the ThunderDome hosted at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida.

‘Puss in Boots: Last Wish’: Swashbuckling feline has one life left…

The upcoming movie will star Antonio Banderas as the voice of the boot-wearing feline, after he previously played the animated character in the 2011 movie, as well as in three of the four Shrek movies, two television specials, and the 2012 short film, Puss in Boots: The Three Diablos.

Puss in Boots: Last Wish is being helmed by Joel Crawford, and will see the titular swashbuckling cat setting out on an epic journey to find the mythical Last Wish after burning through eight of his nine lives.

In the same announcement, DreamWorks and Universal also confirmed a release date for the previously announced adaptation of The Bad Guys, which will now open on 15 April 2022.

The movie is based on the blockbuster series of books by Aaron Blabey and is the feature debut of director Pierre Perifel, who worked on the Kung Fu Panda films.

The Bad Guys follows five animals often depicted as evil in animated stories – Mr Wolf, Mr Snake, Mr Piranha, Mr Shark, and Ms Tarantula – who attempt to turn to a life of good after giving up on their villainous ways.

The film is produced by Damon Ross and Rebecca Huntley, while the executive producers are Blabey, Etan Cohen and Patrick Hughes.

https://www.thesouthafrican.com/lifestyle/entertainment/britney-spears-bbc-freebritney-documentary/,#FreeBritney: BBC to release new ‘Britney’ documentary,"The BBC has announced plans to release a documentary about pop princess Britney Spears and her conservatorship. The move comes after the success of the FX/Hulu documentary Framing Britney Spears which aired on 5 February 2021.

Released as an edition of The New York Times Presents series, the film chronicled Spears’s rise to fame, her treatment by the paparazzi, her highly publicised 2007 breakdown, and her court-mandated conservatorship (overseen by her father Jamie Spears) that she has been living under since 2008.

It also examines the nature of the conservatorship which sparked the fan-led #FreeBritney movement.

BBC doccie to focus on #FreeBritney movement

The BBC’s Britney documentary will follow Bafta-winning journalist Mobeen Azhar as he travels from the singer’s hometown of Kentwood, Louisiana, to Los Angeles. The film is said to focus on the #FreeBritney movement, the fans who created it, and the singer’s recent court appearances.

Speaking about the new project, Azhar said…

“I went to LA in search of the truth of how Britney Spears, one of the biggest pop stars on the planet, ended up in a conservatorship. I found myself in a world of lawyers, superfans, and paparazzi and spent time with many of the people who’ve had a front-row seat in Britney’s life. This film taps into the energy of the #FreeBritney movement and questions the industry, fandom, and the laws that facilitate conservatorships.”

Why do fans want to #FreeBritney?

The California Courts state that a conservatorship refers to instances when a judge appoints an individual or organization to care for another adult who is deemed unfit to care for themselves or manage their finances. Due to her seemingly erratic behavior and very public breakdown in 2008, Spears was put under a “5150 hold” in a psychiatric hospital for a mental health evaluation.

At the time, she was released into her father’s care after Jamie petitioned courts for an emergency “temporary” conservatorship. His reason for filing the petition was due to his daughter being (seemingly) unable to care for herself and manage her mental health issues. Jamie was then given the legal right to oversee and make decisions regarding Britney’s finances, health, business deals, and personal life which he managed until 2019.

But during the years of Spears’ conservatorship, she has repeatedly toured the world, released multiple albums, and worked on a variety of television shows. This has led fans to wonder why someone capable of so much is still having her basic rights infringed upon. The singer’s supporters have also protested on her behalf, demanding an end to the conservatorship.

Britney will broadcast on BBC Two, with Abacus Media Rights selling internationally.

It will also include behind-the-scenes clips of Madonna in action, and is set to detail the battles she had with hip and knee injuries, which forced her to cancel several of her tour dates.

‘Madame X’ might be too X-rated, says Madonna

However, the Like a Virgin hitmaker has suggested it might be too X-rated for some platforms and admitted she would be thrilled if it did end up on the adult site.

She told fans on Instagram: “You should definitely have had that woman get her t*** out in ‘Like A Prayer’.

“I mean if nobody wants to buy this show and we end up on a porn site, it would be good.

“OnlyFans – do they have a format to show a whole show? All right, well that’s something to think about.

“It could make people feel a little bit uncomfortable because art is art, here to disturb the peace.”

30 years after ‘Truth or Dare’

Last month, a source claimed: “Madonna quite literally put blood, sweat and tears into the ‘Madame X’ tour and she wants this documentary to show it off for the spectacle that it was.

“She’s never been the type to fade into the background, so viewers will definitely get to witness her dry sense of humour.

“She has spent weeks watching previews and helping to edit the footage at home in the US and is very hands- on with it.”

The upcoming film will come 30 years after her ground-breaking documentary Truth Or Dare, which chronicled her life during her Blond Ambition tour.

But her return will not quite be in the way fans might expect.

A younger version of the media mogul will appear in flashbacks to the early days of her career. Back then, she was simply known as journalist CJ Grant.

Newcomer Eliza Help cast as Cat Grant

As revealed by Entertainment Weekly, newcomer Eliza Helm has been cast to take on the role and will be featured in episode five (Prom Night) and six (Prom Again!) of the upcoming season.

When viewers are introduced to CJ, she is eager to step out of Lois Lane’s shadow and out from under her boss Perry White’s thumb. So she does what any good journalist would do and chases down a story that leads her to Kara’s hometown of Midvale.

Although the lead doesn’t go as planned, it puts her on the trajectory to becoming the revered media powerhouse everyone knows as Cat Grant.

Cat Grant originally played by Calista Flockhart

Calista Flockhart played Cat Grant in season one, with a few guest appearances in seasons two and three. Cat Grant was often seen as outwardly shallow and superficial. As the founder of media conglomerate CatCo Worldwide Media, she regularly advised Kara about being a woman in a man’s world.

She also investigated and revealed the family link between Supergirl and Superman, causing Kara to become the target of her cousin’s villainous enemies. After leaving her media empire in the capable hands of James Olsen, Cat moved on to become the White House’s new press secretary.

Knowing how dangerous this makes her brother, Lena enlists the team’s help to stop him. But, as Supergirl soon realises, the only way to truly stop Lex is to sacrifice herself.

Two Broke Girls, Friends and Bridgerton, to name a few, represent TV shows no one can arguably watch without wishing they could also enjoy a chocolate milkshake, chicken salad or freshly baked blueberry muffins. In addition, the food we see actors and extras alike eating always looks so good on TV, bringing about the urge to also want to enjoy the same snacks or meals as you’re watching.

Perhaps, an argument can be made that there’s just something about watching others eat that also makes one hungry. If you are one of those, you can grab an array of assorted snacks as well as deliciously prepared ‘heat and eat’ meals from your local stores. Big range of products like this you can find in Woolworths, Boxer, Makro and others.

Back to the big question, do actors really eat the food that we see them have access to in multiple scenes of a TV show? The delightful answer is yes. Various sources have confirmed that 95% of the time actors do indeed eat all the delicious food that we see them being served, or pretending to cook in shows. However, it can get tricky depending on the script or point of any particular scene. For example, if multiple takes are required for a specific scene, it is said that actors typically have to spit out the food to avoid getting too full over the course of multiple takes.

I believe you will be happy to know that none of the food we see on TV shows actually goes to waste because it is often carefully sourced, paid for and the result of the hard work of a food stylist. To ensure nothing gets wasted, the entire crew is said to have access after the scene that requires the food is complete. In some instances, it has been noted that actors might choose not to eat beforehand so that they are able to enjoy what they are given on set, or if the scene does not allow for proper eating, they ask for the food to be saved for later when they are done filming.

Sometimes, like in the show Bridgerton, where the display of food is usually extravagant, how the food looks and is translated to the audience is regarded as too important to be left to anyone other than a seasoned food stylist. In most cases, even in the scenes where a simple plate of food is filmed, a food stylist has usually put in the time and creativity needed to make the food look artistic and aesthetically pleasing.

Food stylist Jennifer Joyce says that her job involves creating irresistible visuals that will make audiences want to lick their screens. According to Joyce, food styling is a very taxing job requiring long hours, and sometimes, on your feet. When tasked with an idea such as the consideration of multiple takes during filming, several hours are required to source ingredients and to set-up various angles from which the food can get captured on camera. Food stylists also need to be aware of any allergies or religious dietary preferences of all actors on set so as to avoid any health scares or violations.

So, there we have it. There is no longer a need to wonder about the fate of the food that we see being served on our favourite TV shows.",Arts/Culture/Celebrities,https://www.thesouthafrican.com/
https://www.thesouthafrican.com/lifestyle/entertainment/avatar-highest-grossing-film-in-history/,Back on top: ‘Avatar’ reclaims title as highest-grossing movie of all time,"The sci-fi movie Avatar, which was first released back in 2009, has reclaimed the record after overtaking Avengers: Endgame. Avatar‘s recent spike in popularity was largely driven by the film’s reissue in China, which saw it take an estimated $8.9m (R132.2m), according to Deadline.

This money helped bridge the gap between Avatar and the hit Marvel movie, which starred the likes of Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Robert Downey Jr and Brie Larson.

Previously, a gap of $7.82m (R116.2m) had existed between the two films. Avengers: Endgame took the record to $2.797bn (R41.5bn) after its release in 2019.

‘Avatar’ held record for more than a decade

Before the release of the Marvel movie, Avatar had held the record for more than a decade, having surpassed the previous record set by Titanic.

And despite being more than 10 years old, Cameron recently insisted his epic sci-fi movie was as relevant now when it was first released.

Film’s themes all still relevant

The acclaimed filmmaker — who also directed Titanic — told China.org:

“We’ve got climate change, we’ve got deforestation, our relationship with nature is more at risk than it’s ever been, and Avatar is about those things, but it also is a timeless film.

“Some people criticise the stories for being too simple. It wasn’t that simple — it was universal. It was something that everybody everywhere could understand and emotionally related to,” Cameron said.

‘AVATAR’ SEQUEL IN THE WORKS

The filmmaker is working on an Avatar sequel and though production work was suspended at one point in 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic, it was subsequently restarted in New Zealand.

Despite this, the sequel has seen its release date moved back, and the eagerly awaited new film is now not due to reach cinemas until December 2022.

The series is billed as an epic drama that focuses on one man’s journey from stigmatized childhood to warrior king. Written by Olu Odebunmi and Tolu Awosika, Shaka: King of the Zulu Nation is rooted in actual events.

The story chronicles Shaka’s unlikely rise to power, uniting multiple tribes across vast stretches of Africa in the early 19th century to transform his power into legend, on par with history’s most seminal figures. From epic battles that test the body and soul to alliances that examine the bonds of love and friendship, a complex sociological system plays out that brings the human cost to the forefront.

Watch: History of Shaka Zulu – Legendary Warrior & Ruler Zulu Empire

Speaking to Variety about the new series director Antoine Fuqua said…

“This project offers a gateway to our past that is so critical to our global history and yet so often marginalized. Through Shaka: King of the Zulu Nation, we hope to bring this saga to life, all the tears, sweat, and blood, all the joy and sorrow, all the intimacy and intensity and humanity. In short, we’re going to rock the world with this one.”

Fuqua has been passionate about telling King Shaka’s story since 2016

This particular project has been years in the making for Fuqua who’s been passionate about telling King Shaka’s story since 2016. “I want to make a movie about an African king or an African warrior,” he told media outlet Deadline. “Did you know we had our own Alexander? I don’t remember seeing an epic movie made about Shaka Zulu. Yet.”

In addition to the Denzel Washington starrer Training Day, Fuqua’s directing credits include The Equalizer films, The Magnificent Seven, Southpaw, Shooter, Olympus Has Fallen, and King Arthur.",Arts/Culture/Celebrities,https://www.thesouthafrican.com/

Speaking on Jimmy Kimmel Live, he said: “I asked you that on the night that SEAL Team Six took out Osama bin Laden at your husband’s order, did you and your husband make love that night to celebrate.”

Michelle, 57, laughed and decided to “turn that back” on the host.

‘You’re still that little boy in your bedroom’ – Michelle Obama

She quipped: “You know, I have to tell your audience that for some very sick reason, you are very obsessed with this portion of that major, historical event in a way that no one else — no one, in the history of all the conversations I’ve had, has anybody drilled down on this particular point like you, Jimmy Kimmel.

“So I turn that back on you… That’s what you want to know. You’re still that little boy in your bedroom, under the cover with the flashlight, going, ‘I hope nobody sees me’.”

Jimmy Kimmel also posed same question to Barack Obama

Regarding the question itself, she added: “I’m still pleading the fifth of that”.

Jimmy has even asked Barack himself, 59, the same thing as recently as October 2020, and the former US president suggested his wife was “asleep”.

He said: “I suspect she was asleep. ‘Cause the truth of the matter, most of the time, by the time I was done working, she’d be snoozing. So, Michelle goes to bed about 9 o’clock.”

https://www.thesouthafrican.com/lifestyle/entertainment/sharon-osbourne-the-talk-piers-morgan-racism/,Sharon Osbourne might walk ‘The Talk’ after Piers Morgan racism row,"The CBS panel show The Talk is currently on a temporary hiatus this week pending an internal network review after the 10 March episode and Sharon Osbourne’s explosive confrontation with co-host Sheryl Underwood.

The hosts clashed over Sharon’s decision to defend her friend Piers Morgan against allegations of racism in the wake of his departure from UK TV show Good Morning Britain.

‘I don’t know whether I want to go back’

Now, Sharon has told Entertainment Tonight: “I wish we could go on and have [an] adult conversation calmly and work it out, but I don’t know whether we can.

“I don’t know whether it’s gone past that. I would love to, but I don’t know whether I even want to go back… I don’t know whether I’m wanted there.”

The news comes after CBS decided to pull the plug on the live shows on Monday 15 March and Tuesday 16 March following the heated row between Sharon and Sheryl.

Here’s how it all went down on ‘The Talk’

The discussion started on The Talk when Sharon was talking about defending Piers over comments he made following Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan’s interview with Oprah Winfrey, including insisting he didn’t believe her when she said she’d had suicidal thoughts.

In response, Sheryl said: “While you are standing by your friend, it appears that you are giving validation or safe haven to something that he has uttered that is racist.”

Sharon replied: “Educate me, tell me when you have heard him say racist things?

“I very much feel like I’m about to be put in the electric chair because I have a friend, who many people think is a racist, so that makes me a racist?

“How can I be racist about anybody or anything in my life.”

The show then cut to a commercial break, but when it returned, she continued to press Sheryl for an explanation as to what was racist about Piers’s comments and added: “And don’t try and cry, because if anyone should be crying, it should be me.”

Sharon Osbourne: ‘I feel blindsided and set up’

Now, Sharon has claimed she felt “blindsided” and “set up” with the grilling she received from her co-stars.

She explained: “It was like, you’re asking me the questions, you’ve got the questions written down there, and I haven’t even had time to get my head together to come up with a correct answer here.

“You’re the one accusing me. And I didn’t even know this was happening. It was between her and I. I’m the one that should be crying here. My a** is on the line. I’ve just been pounced on, not even prepared for it.”

Apology issued, but…

And the 68-year-old star – who has also denied allegations of using racist and homophobic slurs toward her co-hosts – has “apologised” to Sheryl after their row, although she hasn’t heard back yet.

She added: “I own up to what I did. I can’t not own up. I said what I said. I got too personal with Sheryl. I should’ve never said stop her tears.

“She was hurting as I was hurting… I love Sheryl, I’ve apologised to Sheryl, she’s not gotten back and I can understand. Sheryl needs her time.”",Arts/Culture/Celebrities,https://www.thesouthafrican.com/
https://www.thesouthafrican.com/lifestyle/entertainment/swan-lake-st-petersburg-ballet-theatre-artscape-2022/,Kept on their toes: St Petersburg Ballet postpones ‘Swan Lake’ to 2022,"South African ballet lovers who were eager to see the St Petersburg Ballet Theatre production of Swan Lake will now have to wait even longer, as the dancers are being kept on their toes by the coronavirus pandemic.

When COVID-19 began in March 2020, Artscape was only weeks away from hosting the St Petersburg Ballet Theatre. Since then, it had been an extraordinary challenge for the live performance community in South Africa and all over the world, Artscape Theatre Centre CEO Dr Marlene le Roux said.

However, Artscape said it was committed to once again hosting large international shows as soon as it was practical to do so.

‘Swan Lake’ at Artscape Opera House in July 2022

With support of the Cape Town Philharmonic Orchestra, St Petersburg Ballet Theatre and Artscape’s theatre management team, Le Roux said she was pleased that a rescheduled season of the St Petersburg Ballet Theatre’s Swan Lake could be secured for the Artscape Opera House from 7 to 17 July 2022.

In Johannesburg, where the Swan Lake performances will be accompanied by the Johannesburg Festival Orchestra, the season has been rescheduled at the Teatro Montecasino from 20 to 31 July 2022.

St Petersburg ballet company continues rehearsing

St Petersburg Ballet Theatre founding director Konstantin Tachkin said he and the dancers were humbled by the generosity and understanding of South African audiences who had retained their tickets or donated them to charity.

Under the artistic leadership of prima ballerina Irina Kolesnikova, the company has continued to take classes and rehearse for their return to live performances.

Founded in 1994, the St Petersburg Ballet Theatre is renowned for its Vaganova-trained dancers and its stunning, full-length productions. They perform classical masterpieces such as Giselle, Don Quixote, The Nutcracker, Sleeping Beauty and Swan Lake.

In recent years, they have performed in cities like New York, London, Paris, Stockholm, Oslo, Hong Kong, Seoul, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Melbourne, Auckland, Cape Town and Johannesburg.

‘Swan Lake’ still going head

Producer Simon Bryce said the season still going ahead, albeit later than planned, provided a huge morale boost for the dancers, South African musicians and support workers involved.

“Despite the challenges of the past year, our commitment to bring the St Petersburg Ballet Theatre back to South Africa has never wavered. We are optimistic for the future, and determined to play our part in the post-pandemic economic and artistic recovery,” Artscape said.

How to book for ‘Swan Lake’

Bookings for Swan Lake can be made through Computicket, Shoprite and Checkers. Tickets range from R250 to R690, with reduced prices for mid-week and Sunday evening performances.

There are special prices for students and pensioners for Wednesday and Sunday evening performances, available only through Computicket outlets with student card and pensioner ID shown.

Computicket has communicated the new dates to existing ticket holders via email and SMS, and advised that tickets already held would automatically be transferred to the new dates and performance times.

Existing ticket holders can accept the new performance date, change their tickets to another date, or donate, gift or return their tickets. This can be done by emailing Computicket at info@computicket.com before 31 March.

The four-part Snyder showcase is set to premiere internationally on Thursday 18 March on HBO Max. Fans outside the United States have been told to check their local listings for availability.

Unfortunately, fans in South Africa were left wanting after details of the film’s release did not include any local dates. While Zack Snyder himself has been critical of the studio’s international distribution plans, not much has been done to rectify the situation locally.

Zack Snyder’s Justice League will be available worldwide in all markets on the same day as in the U.S. on March 18 via on-demand, digital download, linear, or streaming. #SnyderCut #SnydercutWorldwide (1/2) pic.twitter.com/GjKKsmUkNc — Zack Snyder's Justice League (@snydercut) February 19, 2021

Local Zack Snyder fans create online campaign

But all hope may not be lost as a couple of local Snyder fans have created an online campaign. After being the only media outlet in South Africa to gain early access to screeners for Zack Snyder’s Justice League, Fortress of Solitude editor-in-chief Jarrod Saunders and Podcast host Sergio Pereira decided to start a social media campaign encouraging local cinemas and/or broadcasters to air the four-part film.

Speaking to The South African about their decision to start the petition, Saunders said:

“After reviewing the film and sharing our thoughts on social media, DCEU fans across South Africa approached us with questions regarding how they can watch the film locally. We contacted Warner Bros but they confirmed that there are currently no plans for the film to be shown in the country — at least not theatrically. “We also contacted Showmax, who are responsible for bringing most of HBO’s shows and movies to South Africa. Unfortunately, they weren’t able to confirm that the film would be available on their platform either.”

The two sensed how frustrated local fans were with the lack of options available to watch The Snyder Cut and so they started the online campaign to bring this dilemma to the attention of DStv, Showmax, Ster-Kinekor and Nu Metro.

“We would love for the film to be shown at the IMAX or Scene Xtreme,” Saunders said. “The second prize is if it’s available on a popular local streaming network.”

Fans urged to use #ZSJLSouthAfrica hashtag

Fortress of Solitude believes that the fans can make this happen. While there is no formal petition to sign, the site encourages people to use the #ZSJLSouthAfrica hashtag on social media when sharing their pleas to bring Zack Snyder’s Justice League to South Africa.

At the time of writing, DC Universe Infinite reported that Zack Snyder’s Justice League had been announced for Google Play and Vodacom in South Africa. Other than that official confirmation has been lacking.

Zack Snyder’s ‘Justice League’: The cast

Zack Snyder’s Justice League takes place after the death of Superman. The story follows Bruce Wayne as he enlists the help of his newfound ally, Diana Prince, to face an even greater enemy. Together, Batman and Wonder Woman find and recruit a team of heroes to protect the world from Steppenwolf and his army of Parademons – who seek the three Mother Boxes.

The movie stars Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Gal Gadot, Jason Momoa, Ezra Miller, Ray Fisher, Jesse Eisenberg and Amy Adams. Along with the original cast, Jared Leto is back as Joker and Joe Manganiello is returning as Deathstroke.

‘Mank’ leads Oscar nominations list

Elsewhere, Mank leads the Oscar nominations with 10 nods. The movie centres around Herman J Mankiewicz and how he penned the screenplay for Citizen Kane. Mank has received a huge 10 nominations ahead of the upcoming ceremony in April.

The film received coveted nods in the Best Picture category as well as Best Director for David Fincher, Best Actor for Gary Oldman and Best Supporting Actress for Amanda Seyfried.

The movie — which had a short cinema release before being made available on streaming service Netflix — also made a strong appearance in the design categories including Production Design, Makeup and Hairstylisting and Costume Design, as well as technical categories such as Cinematography, Sound and Score.

Anthony Hopkins plays key role in ‘The Father’

The Father received six nominations across the board. Besides Anthony Hopkins’ nomination, Olivia Colman will contest the Best Supporting Actress category.

The Oscars will take place on 26 April from different locations owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.

https://www.thesouthafrican.com/lifestyle/entertainment/oscars-nominations-2021/,Five surprise takeaways from the Oscars nominations,"But there were plenty of surprises and records among the Academy’s picks, from diversity landmarks to the venue itself.

Here are five takeaways from the Academy Award nominations announcement:

1. Who’s the lead?

It is a debate that has plagued movie sets since the Oscars began — which A-lister is billed as the lead actor, and which must swallow their pride and settle for “supporting”?

Bizarrely, for Judas and the Black Messiah, it would seem neither actor is the star.

Both Globe-winning Daniel Kaluuya and LaKeith Stanfield were nominated as best supporting actor for their portrayals of black civil rights activist Fred Hampton and FBI informant William O’Neall.

Unlike other ceremonies, the Oscars place actors in the category for which they receive the most votes.

“Only Oscar voters could watch a film about two black men and decide both must be supporting characters,” tweeted the Telegraph’s film critic Robbie Collin.

2. #OscarsSoDiverse?

Despite years of #OscarsSoWhite criticism, Monday’s nominations saw multiple diversity landmarks set.

Steven Yuen became the first Asian-American nominated as best actor for Minari, and will compete against Riz Ahmed (Sound of Metal) — the first Pakistani-origin star nominated.

Viola Davis became the most nominated black actress ever, landing her fourth nod for Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom.

She will compete against Andra Day in The United States vs Billie Holiday — the first time two black women have featured in the category.

In total, a record nine actors of color were nominated across the four acting categories.

But there were snubs for Ma Rainey and One Night in Miami — two acclaimed films featuring all-black casts and directors — in the coveted Oscar for best picture nominations.

3. ‘Live from Platform 8…’

Before the nominations even got under way, Academy president David Rubin dropped the news that Oscars night will be split between Hollywood’s Dolby Theatre — and a train station.

Details are still thin on the ground, but the enormous Union Station in downtown Los Angeles will allow for plenty of social distancing among stars, seeming to indicate a more “in-person” approach to the prizegiving compared with the mainly virtual Golden Globes and Emmys.

The announcement came just nine hours after the well-received Grammys, which saw many of the music industry’s top names attend and perform at the socially distanced gala in Los Angeles.

4. 36th time lucky

Romanian cinema has a long history of being snubbed by the Academy.

It had doggedly submitted 35 previous movies for the Oscars, without securing a single nomination — until Monday.

Shocking corruption documentary Collective not only ended the Eastern European nation’s long barren streak with a best international film nod, but added a rare second for best documentary.

Tunisia also landed its first ever Oscars pick with The Man Who Sold His Skin, at a relatively economical seventh time of trying.

Both will have to see off presumed frontrunner Another Round, the Danish dark comedy about drinking that also earned Thomas Vinterberg a directing nomination.

5. ‘Promising Young Woman’

At the other end of the spectrum, Oscars recognition came startlingly fast for 35-year-old British director Emerald Fennell.

She became the first woman ever nominated for directing her debut film, with Promising Young Woman.

The #MeToo thriller about a revenge-seeker feigning drunkenness at bars to prey on misogynist men ended up with five nominations, also including best picture.

“FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU….” wrote Fennell following the announcement — adding: “Never going to stop crying.”

https://mg.co.za/section/business/,Business News brought to you by South Africa's best read!,There are still too few top positions filled by black leaders - we need to work tirelessly to change that,Business,https://mg.co.za/
https://mg.co.za/business/2021-03-31-south-africa-tops-g20-coal-reliance-list-in-2020-report-finds/,"South Africa tops G20 coal-reliance list in 2020, report finds","South Africa retained its top ranking on the G20 list for countries most reliant on coal-fired power in 2020 and will likely remain in that position this year.

The Global Electricity Review report by independent energy think-tank Ember analysed electricity data from every country in the world last year.

In 2020, 86% of South Africa’s electricity came from coal, compared to the global average of 34%. It is significantly ahead of the next highest G20 member, India, which generates 71% of its electricity from coal.

Among the report’s key observations is that South Africa is experiencing an unprecedented electricity crisis, which has seen electricity demand fall 5.4% since 2015.

“Spiralling costs of new coal plants have placed the state-owned utility Eskom in dire financial situation, leading to increased electricity tariffs, which have caused electricity demand to stagnate,” the report said.

The data showed that in 2020 the growth in wind and solar helped push coal power to a record fall of 4%, as coal generation dropped by 346 terawatt-hours.

The report, however, warns that models from the International Energy Agency show that coal power must fall 14% every year to keep the world on track for 2050 net-zero emissions. “As electricity demand growth picks up again, wind and solar will need to significantly accelerate to ensure that coal continues to fall,” Ember said in a statement.

New coal-fired power procurement

South Africa is planning to procure 2 500 megawatts of coal-fired power generation by December 2021 through its coal baseload independent power producer procurement programme.

Civil society groups have launched significant campaigns against new coal-fired power plants being built. In 2017, the Thabametsi coal-fired power was stopped by a court ruling. And this year Groundwork scored a victory when the water licence granted for the 600MW Khanyisa coal-fired power plant in the Mpumalanga was revoked by the South African water tribunal.

Both cases involved strong arguments for climate-change considerations that had been neglected in the projects’ planning. As well as the legal challenges launched by environmental rights groups, the projects also suffered a number of setbacks, including the withdrawal of funding by a number of commercial banks under pressure to stop funding coal power.

“South Africa already faces a tough challenge in successfully decarbonising its coal-heavy grid. But any continued investment in coal generation will make the scale of this challenge harder, and further entwine the fate of the economy with that of the coal sector,” said Euan Graham, an electricity-tracking analyst at Ember.

“The government’s recently stated ambition to reach net-zero by 2050 is a welcome announcement, but massive deployment of cheap wind and solar is crucial to pursuing an orderly transition away from coal, while navigating a path out of the current electricity crisis affecting the country.”

An enormous challenge

Dave Jones, global lead at the energy research hub, reiterated that despite coal’s record drop during the pandemic, it still fell short of what is needed to address the climate crisis.

“Coal power needs to collapse by 80% by 2030 to avoid dangerous levels of warming above 1.5°C. We need to build enough clean electricity to simultaneously replace coal and electrify the global economy. World leaders have yet to wake up to the enormity of the challenge,” Jones said.

The global review data shows that, despite the record 2020 fall in coal, power sector emissions were still about 2% higher in the year of the pandemic than in 2015 when the Paris Agreement was signed.

The agency’s Electricity Market Report 2020 expects that globally, coal-fired generation will increase by about 3% in 2021, and that gas-fired plants will increase output by about 1%. “This would lead to a rise in CO₂ emissions from the power sector of about 2% in 2021,” it said in December last year.

For its review, Ember analysed 68 countries, comprising 90% of world electricity generation. The data showed that the world is producing more power fossil fuels than in 2015.

“There is an expectation that coal is the dirtiest fossil fuel and will, therefore, be the first to be phased out. South Africa has the highest coal reliance of any electricity grid of the G20 countries, but also it has such good solar resources and land space, it is in a position to reduce its coal reliance quicker and cheaper than any other country,” Jones told the Mail & Guardian.

“South Africa, as such a big coal generator, and with so many opportunities to quickly replace coal generation with clean electricity, would need to be collapsing its coal generation much faster than it’s currently planning.”

The review showed that wind and solar already supplied a 10th of the world’s electricity last year, double from five years ago.

South Africa’s low-emissions development strategy 2020 plans a low-carbon pathway that will see coal peak in 2025, then begin to plateau and, eventually, steadily decline after 2030. The strategy is grounded in the extensive global body of research from climate scientists, which confirms the relationship between human-induced greenhouse gas emissions, higher global average surface",Business,https://mg.co.za/
https://mg.co.za/business/2021-03-30-uptick-in-jobs-driven-by-part-time-work/,Uptick in jobs driven by part-time work,"There were more than half a million fewer full-time jobs at the end of 2020 than in December 2019. This is according to Statistics South Africa’s (StatsSA) quarterly employment data, which shows that part-time employment also decreased in this period. The data excludes the informal business sector, agriculture, hunting, forestry, fishing and domestic services.

Total employment increased by 76 000 quarter-on-quarter, from 9 564 000 in September 2020 to 9 640 000 in December 2020.

But the data suggests that employment recovery was driven by an increase in part-time employment. While part-time jobs increased by 87 000, 11 000 full-time jobs were lost between the two quarters. This was largely a result of employment losses in construction, manufacturing, business services, transport and mining.

Total employment decreased by 594 000 year-on-year between December 2019 and December 2020. Most of those jobs — 565 000 — were full-time.

According to the data, earnings were also hit in 2020. Year-on-year, total gross earnings decreased by R36.1-billion between December 2019 and December 2020. In this period, basic wages decreased by R22.9-billion.

But wages did recover by R18.6-billion between quarters. This is attributed to increases in community services, business services, trade, manufacturing, construction, transport, mining and electricity.

Covid-19 induced unprecedented job losses in South Africa and abroad. According to StatsSA’s most recent quarterly labour-force survey, which looks at jobs across all sectors, the unemployment rate reached 32.5% in the last months of 2020. This is the highest unemployment rate since the survey began in 2008.

Despite earlier indications of South Africa’s economic recovery, there were still almost 1.4-million fewer people employed in the last quarter of 2020 than in the same period in 2019.

According to global data from the International Labour Organisation (ILO), in 2020 8.8% of global working hours were lost compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. This is the equivalent to 255-million full-time jobs.

The scale of pandemic-related working-hour losses were about four times greater than during the global financial crisis in 2009, the ILO noted.",Business,https://mg.co.za/
https://mg.co.za/business/2021-03-27-big-banks-under-pressure-to-end-fossil-fuel-finance/,Big banks under pressure to end fossil-fuel finance,"Banks worldwide are buckling to pressure from shareholders to end fossil-fuel financing, with Europe’s HSBC becoming one of the world’s largest banks to announce a plan to end all new coal financing on 11 March.

This represents a significant move by Europe’s second-largest fossil-fuel financier and is another indication that the global banking system is slowly adjusting to the reality of climate change risks.

So how did HSBC, a bank that has committed $86.5-billion in fossil-fuel financing since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015, suddenly change its investment path? The answer is shareholder engagement.

Shareholder-engagement groups are proving to be effective in facilitating conversations between experts, NGOs and large shareholders that result in important resolutions tabled at annual general meetings (AGMs).

In the case of HSBC, NGO Share Action successfully convinced a coalition of shareholders and institutional investors with a joint value of $2.4-trillion to file a resolution calling for the bank to release its plan to end coal-fired-power financing.

“HSBC provided billions in loans and underwriting to companies heavily exposed to coal and building new coal power plants since the signing of the Paris climate agreement,” said Wolfgang Kuhn, director of financial sector strategies at Share Action. “The amounts are not significant in the context of HSBC’s enormous balance sheet. Still, they are enormous in the context of a carbon budget, which is quickly heading to the red.”

After the resolution tabled in January this year, ahead of HSBC’s AGM in May, earlier this month the bank announced its plan to phase out coal financing, prompting the coalition to withdraw their resolution. In a letter written to the bank’s chief executive, Noel Quinn, and chairperson, Mark Tucker, the coalition welcomed HSBC’s decision.

“The focus now must be on putting these plans into practice. We look forward to working with the board on the development of its targets and plans. HSBC’s coal phase-out plan is particularly urgent, given the carbon intensity of the sector, and the vital role that HSBC can play in helping to accelerate a shift away from coal-dependent activities, particularly in Asia,” the letter reads.

The letter ends with a warning that the coalition will keep a close watch on the bank’s activities. “While we have withdrawn the shareholder resolution this year, we may take further action next year if we are unsatisfied with the bank’s progress,” the coalition said.

In 2019, Share Action facilitated a similar resolution for Barclays AGM, which saw the bank respond with its plan, similar to the developments at HSBC.

Local banks and lucrative fossil-fuel assets

Five South African banks have put forward climate risk-related shareholder resolutions over the past few years. In 2019 Standard Bank and FirstRand tabled resolutions on climate-risk disclosure, and in 2020 Nedbank and Absa followed suit.

Just Share, a nonprofit shareholder activism and engagement organisation in South Africa, believes it is almost business as usual for banks operating on the continent.



“One of the three objectives of the Paris Agreement is to make finance flows compatible with the transition to a low-carbon economy. So, if you’re a bank that claims to support the Paris goals, you’d be setting ambitious targets for rapidly and responsibly phasing out funding to existing fossil fuel projects and excluding finance for new ones,” Just Share director Tracey Davies wrote in an opinion piece.

“But in the banking world, it seems you can simultaneously support the Paris goals and plan to expand fossil fuel funding hugely.”

In 2020 Investec became the first South African bank to release a separate report aligned with the recommendations from the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

The Financial Sustainability Board created the TCFD to improve and increase reporting of climate-related financial information. Investec’s report discloses all fossil-fuel risk exposures in its portfolio to shareholders.

In the same year, the bank released a group fossil fuel policy, committing to releasing its exposures.

“Investec’s climate change report does not fully align with the TCFD recommendations, and there are some significant gaps: for example, the bank has not conducted any climate scenario analysis (although it plans to do so in the financial year to March 2021). It also does not set out any targets for carbon-emission metrics, which is essential for achieving alignment with climate goals.

“However, the report clearly articulates a plan for ongoing improvement in disclosures, and the publication of this first report will also allow stakeholders to track the bank’s progress in meeting its commitments,” Just Share said in a statement.

According to the TCFD, chaired by Michael Bloomberg, the financial crisis of 2007-2008 was an important reminder of the repercussions that weak corporate-governance and risk-management practices can have on asset values.

One study by the Economist Intelligence Unit, The Cost of Inaction: Recognising the Value at Risk from Climate Change, found that the estimated value at risk to the total global stock of manageable assets as a result of climate change ranged from $4.2-trillion to $43-trillion between now and the end of the century.

This value at risk depends on different scenarios of warming. For example, the researchers estimated, using this model, that warming of 5°C could result in $7-trillion in losses — more than the total market capitalisation of the London Stock Exchange; a rise to 6°C of warming could lead to a present-value loss of $13.8-trillion of manageable financial assets, about 10% of the global total.

When the expected losses for governments and socioeconomic effects are added to this, the expected value of a future with 6°C of warming represents present value losses worth $43-trillion.

According to the TCFD report, “Organisations that invest in activities that may not be viable in the longer term may be less resilient to the transition to a lower-carbon economy, and their investors will likely experience lower returns.

“Compounding the effect on longer-term returns is the risk that present valuations do not adequately factor in climate-related risks because of insufficient information,” the report continues. “As such, long-term investors need adequate information on how organisations are preparing for a lower-carbon economy.”

Climate action in the financial sector is gaining momentum. Still, experts warn that the voluntary and non-legally binding policies adopted by many of its major role players leave room for new fossil-fuel projects to continue unabated in the absence of legal, regulatory frameworks that fall strictly in line with the recommendations by the world’s top climate scientists at the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

Climate change and sovereign credit ratings

A team of economists at the Cambridge Judge Business School have warned that the first “climate smart” sovereign credit ratings suggest global warming ratings downgrades as early as 2030.

The economists used artificial intelligence to simulate the effects of climate change on S&P Global Ratings credit ratings for 108 countries.

They assessed this over the next 10, 30 and 50 years, and by the end of the century.

“The majority of countries in our sample will suffer downgrades by 2030 if the current trajectory of carbon emissions is maintained. Virtually all countries, whether rich or poor, hot or cold, will be downgraded by 2100,” said co-author Dr Kamiar Mohaddes.

“Keeping to the Paris Agreement will be tough, but our estimates strongly suggest that stringent climate policy will significantly reduce the impact on ratings.”

New coal power plants not in tune with Paris Agreement

According to scientists, at present, the world is not tracking towards a Paris Agreement-compatible phase-out of coal. A paper published in Climate Analytics shows that current and planned coal-fired power plants globally will lead to a generation increase of 3% by 2030 compared to 2010 levels.

“If the world follows these present trends, this will lead to cumulative emissions from coal-power generation more than three times larger than what would be compatible with the Paris Agreement by 2050,” said the paper, titled Global and regional coal phase-out requirements of the Paris Agreement: Insights from the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] Special Report on 1.5°C.

The 2018 IPCC report warns of catastrophic consequences to the world’s most vulnerable social and economic status as a result of extreme weather and ocean heating.

https://mg.co.za/business/2021-03-26-black-business-needs-a-new-meeting-place/,Black business needs a new meeting place,"COMMENT

The Black Management Forum (BMF) has entered its 45th year of existence, and it will be taking a moment to pause and reflect on its gains and relevance in the South African transformation landscape.

All organisations of consequence have unique beginnings and symbols of hope. The BMF is no different to many organisations that have graced our society and contributed to transformation.

The meeting place of the BMF in the late 1970s and 1980s was undoubtedly the Carlton Hotel in Johannesburg’s former central business district. This was the seminal place where the noble ideas of transformation were birthed. The Carlton was the only place where black leaders could meet without being arrested or harassed by the apartheid government. The hotel had international standing and this reputation was meaningful to white business and the apartheid government. This sop appeasement to the international community was an attempt to display a picture of a country that did not exist outside of the hotel’s foyer.

This meeting place, however, was where other rich ideas lived and were nurtured and were allowed to grow. This place was a moment of freedom for our leaders to express themselves in a country that had subjugated black people beyond human recognition. It was a place where black leaders could boldly appear and challenge the status quo in dreaming of a better future for our people. Many of these managers were employed by multinational enterprises from the United States who had adopted the Sullivan Principles.

These codes were developed by a black American preacher, Reverend Leon H Sullivan, who worked for General Motors. The codes confronted racial segregation in business in South Africa, pressuring the apartheid government to remove laws of separate development.

Key BMF milestones

From the first moments of meeting at the Carlton Hotel, the BMF grew the idea of building a home for black professionals who needed support and development. For the past 45 years, the forum has not shied away from the immediate context of the country, and after the State of Emergency of 1985, began to strengthen its advocacy and onslaught against Corporate South Africa.

Black managers began to articulate political views under the cloak of corporate colours, displaying their intellectual abilities to unravel the deeply rooted and illicit relationship between business and politics. These black managers understood that the genesis of apartheid was not political, but economic.

The BMF also argued at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that business was an extension of the macro-political agenda of apartheid, and therefore had no choice but to be racist because the country already belonged to white people.

The BMF moved on to influence affirmative action in South Africa and developed the Basotho Hat Model to give a unique and clear understanding of affirmative action, which paved the way for the Employment Equity Act. The BMF challenged business to fully transform within seven years after the affirmative action blueprint of 1993 was developed.

The BMF also played a critical role in the establishment of the Black Economic Empowerment Commission in 1998, which led to the landmark B-BBEE Act as amendment.

Nevertheless, the BMF targets of affirmative action have not been achieved because the critical mass of black managers at top management remains elusive.

A view to the future

Business today has an over-reliance on a few black leaders at the highest level in business and a diminishing pool of white leaders, who are trusted more to lead. Through the reintroduction of the Basotho Hat Model in 2021, the BMF is committed to break these artificial glass ceilings and ensure that black leadership is utilised and represented at the highest level.

All black lobby groups need to organise themselves better, anchoring thought leadership and research within their ranks, with ongoing input into policy and giving insight into best business practices.

A critical focus on affirmative action to transform organisational culture, which has been beset and arrested by continuous challenges around black women, unequal pay, systemic racism, values, token black chief executives and chairpersons, who have limited power to advance transformation while appeasing white executives and white owners on matters of transformation.

This focus on corporate culture will impact positively on organisational performance, leading to both staff satisfaction and customer satisfaction.

Black professional organisations should work tirelessly in creating more frameworks and models that can be adopted by government and business to drive economic transformation and sustainable growth.

The BMF is currently working on the Indigenous Management Model, focusing on frameworks and models that will usher in an intellectual revolution, that ought to be anchored in unity and fuelled by the ethos and principle of Ubuntu.

The meeting place today is not the Carlton Hotel, but the constitution of South Africa where a clear mandate to rebuild our country stems from, where business, government, labour and civil society must meet to reimagine and commit to transforming the South African economy.

Let the new meeting place be the intersection of economic justice, fairness, and equity. Let us all meet at the place where we unlock the value of our human capital which will lead to inclusive economic growth — the place where black lives matter.",Business,https://mg.co.za/
https://mg.co.za/business/2021-03-25-reserve-bank-keeps-repo-rate-unchanged/,Reserve Bank keeps repo rate unchanged,"The South African Reserve Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) has decided again to keep the repo rate unchanged, at 3.5%.

The repo rate determines the interest rate at which the central bank lends money to commercial banks — which then affects the rate at which they lend to their consumers.

The rate also affect the inflation rate.

This week, consumer inflation moderated to 2.9% down from 3.2% in January 2021. This was lower than the central bank’s inflation midpoint target of between 3% and 6%.

The Reserve Bank governor, Lesetja Kganyago, said inflation is expected to be well contained in 2021, before rising to around the midpoint of the inflation target range in 2022 and 2023. Therefore, the central bank decided to keep rates unchanged.

“Lower inflation begets lower interest rates, higher inflation begets higher interest rates,” Kganyago said.

He reiterated that last year’s adjustments were possible because the bank had the space to do so. The fact that inflation was declining gave the bank an opportunity to lower the repo rate.

Last year the bank cut the rate by 300 basis points in order to aid the country in recovering from the effects of the pandemic, as well as the various lockdowns.

The bank also noted that until vaccination is widespread and populations develop sufficient immunity to curb virus transmission, it is expected that waves of Covid-19 infection will continue.

“As indicated by public health authorities, a third wave of virus infection is probable in coming months. Despite further expected waves, the start of vaccinations in many countries has lifted projections for global economic growth and boosted confidence significantly,” said Kgayango, adding that has improved global economic growth.

The South African government now plans to inoculate 22-million citizens between November 2021 and February 2022, which is below its earlier target of vaccinating 67% of the population by the end of this year.

Kganyago further said that sharply lower public and private investment last year and the weak economy will continue to weigh down the country’s growth prospects.

Domestic gross domestic product is expected to grow by 3.8% in 2021 and unchanged from the January meeting, expectations for 2022 and 2023 are 2.4% and 2.5%, respectively.

The bank’s projections are higher than the national treasury’s estimates of growth of 3.3% in 2021, moderating to an average of 1.9% in 2022 and 2023.

Kganyago said that load-shedding had hampered the economy, and if it was not for electricity cuts, which took place after the government relaxed lockdown regulations, the economy would have been much stronger.

“I have no doubt that if we did not have load-shedding, this economy would be much stronger than it is in the moment. It is for those reasons that we highlight the risk of the certainty of supply,” he said.

Headline consumer price inflation averaged 3.3% in 2020. The forecast for 2021 is higher at 4.3%, up from 4% in January, and slightly lower for 2022 at 4.4%, down from 4.5%. The forecast for 2023 is 4.5%.",Business,https://mg.co.za/
https://mg.co.za/business/2021-03-24-consumer-price-inflation-eased-in-february/,Consumer price inflation eased in February,"Consumer price inflation (CPI) edged lower to 2.9% in February 2021, down from 3.2% in January 2021. According to Statistics South Africa (StatsSA), the main contributors to the 2.9% annual inflation rate were food and non-alcoholic beverages, housing and utilities, and miscellaneous goods and services.

Food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 5.2% year-on-year, and contributed 0.9% to the total CPI annual rate of 2.9%.

In its release on Wednesday 24 March, StatsSA noted that the ban on alcohol sales from retail outlets, restaurants, bars and hotels in January, meant that there were no base prices available for comparison in February. The monthly changes were thus estimated using the headline change in the CPI for February. Tickets for sports games were also estimated.

Though CPI has softened year on year, South Africa inflation is expected to edge higher in the coming years.

Higher petrol and electricity prices are expected to drive up price inflation throughout the economy.

Earlier this month, the Central Energy Fund forecast that petrol is set for a 90 cents-a-litre rise in April.

Responding to the forecast, the Automobile Association of South Africa said: “The cost is not only direct, but throughout the value chain, and is battering consumers from all sides. It requires urgent review to help ease pressure on consumers who are battling to stay financially afloat.”

Electricity tariffs are also set to rise. From the start of July electricity prices will be hiked by 14.6%, according to the National Energy Regulator of South Africa.

Nedbank economists forecast that inflation is expected to gradually edge higher in 2021, off the low base established in 2020. They expect inflation to average around 4.5% over the next three years.

In January the South African Reserve Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) forecast that headline consumer price inflation would be 4% in 2021, 4.5% in 2022 and 4.6% in 2023.

But the Nedbank economists expect that the Reserve Bank will revise its January inflation forecasts upwards, mainly due to global oil price developments.

https://mg.co.za/business/2021-03-19-sas-biggest-banks-remain-resilient-amid-covid-19-shocks/,SA’s biggest banks remain resilient amid Covid-19 shocks,"Despite recording massive drops in their earnings in 2020, South Africa’s largest banks avoided total meltdown. The country’s banking sector is resilient, a fact that allayed early fears they may not be able to withstand the Covid-19 shock to the economy. A banking sector crisis would have a knock-on effect that would send the country’s financial stability into a tailspin.

In its May 2020 edition of the Financial Stability Review, the South African Reserve Bank noted that profits would likely be under strain as a result of the pandemic. A later edition of the review noted that during the lockdown profit declines in the banking sector reached lows previously reported eight years ago.

The review added, however, that South Africa’s biggest banks “hold sufficient capital buffers to withstand a macroeconomic shock of unprecedented severity”.

Resilience was the message in the last two weeks, as some of the country’s biggest banks released their full-year 2020 financial results. This is despite the still treacherous conditions which saw South Africa’s economy shrink by 7% last year.

The banking sector was however not spared from the onslaught. Standard Bank, Absa and Nedbank all recorded massive declines in their headline earnings. Earlier this month FNB’s parent company, FirstRand, reported a 21% decline in headline earnings in its interim results for the six months ended on December 31.

The main culprit for declines in earnings were credit impairments, which rose as banks restructured some loans and offered repayment holidays to their struggling clients

As the country’s fourth largest bank, Nedbank’s earnings were the hardest hit, falling 57% compared to 2019.

In his message to shareholders, Nedbank chief executive Mike Brown said that despite unprecedented challenges, the sector and Nedbank “demonstrated strong levels of resilience and was able to support clients while remaining well capitalised, liquid and profitable, albeit at levels lower than in the prior year”.

Despite a strong liquidity position, Nedbank, like Absa, decided not to declare a final dividend for 2020 owing to uncertainty about the progression of the virus and the effectiveness of the vaccine roll-out.

Nedbank’s liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) — which requires banks to hold cash or assets that match or exceed projected cash outflows over a 30-day period — was 126%. This was 11% higher than in the first half of the year.

Last year the reserve bank lowered the regulatory minimum for the LCR from 100% to 80%. This change was aimed at making it possible for banks to continue lending amid expected liquidity shortages and a rise in defaults. The objective of the LCR is to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banks.

Similarly upbeat sentiments were expressed earlier in the week, when Absa chief executive Daniel Mminele presented the bank’s results. Absa’s LCR was 121% at the end of 2020.

Absa fared better in the second half of the year, Mminele noted on Monday. The bank’s earnings fell by an alarming 82% in the first six months of 2020 but by the end of the year were down by 51%.

Jeremy Gorven, a senior analyst at investment firm Stonehage Fleming, said the suspension of dividends and the fact the banks remained profitable helped them through 2020. Standard Bank and FirstRand have recently decided to declare dividends following better than expected results.

The average return on equity for the 2020 financial year was 6.9%, Gorven noted. “So that’s much lower than it usually is. But it is still positive, which means without paying dividends, banks are adding to their capital.”

Gorven added that the recovery of economic activity in the second half of 2020 and slower growth in credit losses have helped the banks rebound.

“So in general the outlook is positive for profit growth and returns. But that doesn’t mean the banks will be earning the same returns pre-pandemic. What we will see is uneven recovery and it may take some time.”

Conrad Beyers, the Absa chair in actuarial science at the University of Pretoria, said the results from the banks are much better than was feared when the pandemic hit. The university has conducted high-level stress testing of South Africa’s largest banks.

“One should of course add that banks are still in a very tough and uncertain position,” Beyers added.

But, he added that the expectations had been “really bad”.

“There might have been a possibility of a crisis. So currently those expectations have not been realised,” he said.

“It does not mean it is a rosy picture, or really positive. They lost a lot on credit impairments, which is extremely bad … But at least it appears that the banking system is going to survive — at least for now.”

New law to prevent future crisis domino effect

New legislation for the financial sector will help stop the “doom loop” that happens when big institutions fail during a crisis. This is according to treasury deputy director general Ismail Momoniat who, during parliament’s finance standing committee on Tuesday, explained a banking crisis “impacts on your sovereign risk and it impacts on the fiscus and it creates an economic crisis”.

The treasury was in parliament for a presentation on the Financial Sector Laws Amendment Bill, which is aimed at bolstering financial stability in the country. Part of the Twin Peaks reform of the financial regulatory system, the bill introduces regulations to deal with failing banks.

The cabinet approved the tabling of the bill last June. The bill will minimise the use of public funds as a default source to bail out failing banks and other large financial institutions. Major banks will also have to plan for the possibility of their failure.

In its presentation, the treasury noted that banking crises have historically contributed to large increases in public debt.

“For that reason, you find that governments are forced to come in — it’s almost like having a gun to your head — if you don’t it is going to be a worse crisis … And generally financial crises, if they are the cause of a recession, it takes much longer for the economy to get back to recovery,” Momoniat said.

Banks pose a significant risk to the economy, the treasury said. When one major bank fails, there tends to be a domino effect on a number of connected institutions.

“What we don’t like is that when there are profits to be made, they obviously go to the shareholders of the bank … But when a major bank is in trouble, when there are losses, then society has to take the cost,” Momoniat said.

“And that is the problem we are trying to deal with and prevent.”",Business,https://mg.co.za/

And on Wednesday, parliament’s portfolio committee on public service and administration cautioned the treasury about the effects its budget-saving recommendations would have on the body’s capacity to operate effectively.

After being briefed by the Statistics Council, the statistician general, and the treasury during the meeting, acting chairperson of the portfolio committee Mina Lesoma stated that it would call for additional funding for the organisation because Stats SA’s statistics are vital in informing evidence-based planning.



The treasury has advised Stats SA on budget-saving recommendations after the latest budget cuts to the organisation. These recommendations include reducing the number of district officers, outsourcing field services and reducing the number of vehicles for field workers.



However, according to the South African Statistics Council’s Professor David Everatt, the reduction of field services and workers will have a drastic effect on Stats SA’s operating ability. Stats SA cannot consider small sample sizes in surveys, because this would result in official statistical results being regarded as unreliable, Everatt told the portfolio committee meeting.



The committee cautioned against the treasury’s recommendation to Stats SA to outsource fieldwork services after Stats SA told the committee that, if it were to outsource its fieldwork, “it would be cutting off its legs as outsourcing will cost more to pay consultants”.



Last year, Everatt issued a statement on behalf of the council that spoke to the importance of statistical results, and the detrimental effects of the brain drain at Stats SA. He stated that if the government does not provide the funding needed, the council would have to withdraw its official statistics support.

The council said it will not be able to endorse untrustworthy data. “This is the very worst option for everyone in South Africa, but the council either endorses the release of data everyone can trust, or the council stops because we cannot endorse data we mistrust,” Everatt said in the statement.



Stats SA is the only source of official statistics in South Africa. If the organisation is inadequately funded, it cannot produce official statistics, which will discourage international investors and hamper reliable planning data for domestic businesses.

Last year, in an interview with the Mail & Guardian, statistician general Risenga Maluleke said democracy would flounder without accurate statistics. He said a significant amount of resources go into collecting information for surveys, including the hiring and training of field workers, and providing them with equipment such as vehicles and telephones.

On Wednesday, Maluleke told the portfolio committee that “in the last four years, Stats SA could not appoint or promote staff”. Employees of Stats SA also lacked sufficient compensation during that time, leading to a high staff turnover because of the department’s lack of prospects and promotions. This leaves Stats SA sitting at a 20% vacancy rate. “Stats SA is losing well-experienced employees,” said Maluleke.

Stats SA has experienced budget cuts since the 2015-16 financial year. The budget cuts have also affected the continuation of specific critical surveys.

Treasury deputy director general for public finance Mampho Modise told the portfolio committee that cuts are necessary given the country’s budgetary constraints. She did, however, say that R3-billion had been set aside for the 2021 census survey, but the portfolio committee noted that this was insufficient for the entire project.

Data in the census, which is the most significant undertaking of the organisation, is used to ensure government funds and services are distributed fairly, delineate electoral districts and measure the effects of industrial development. The data contained in the census is also used to determine the unemployment rate.",Business,https://mg.co.za/

But the power utility has also announced plans to retrofit old coal-fired power stations with technologies that will partially improve air pollution and the respiratory health crisis.

This is not a simple process.

The technologies used to reduce air pollution and tackle carbon emissions are different. But Jesse Burton, an associate at the Energy Systems Research Group (ESRG), says addressing air pollution and dealing with climate change through greenhouse gas emission reductions need not be a trade-off if some coal-fired power stations are retired early.

Eskom in its road to cleaner electricity

Burton presented findings for different scenarios at Eskom’s various coal-fired power stations.

It will cost Eskom R300-billion to retro-fit its current coal fleet to meet the minimum air emissions standards relating to particular matter, the utility told parliament’s portfolio committee on minerals and energy. The utility has historically sought exemptions for power stations that emit far above the minimum emissions standards.

For Duvha and Matla power stations in Mpumalanga, the ESRG found potential cost and greenhouse gas emissions savings if compliance with the new standards is suspended for these stations, and they are instead retired early.

“We propose that the department of environmental affairs considers suspending compliance requirements for the best-performing (in terms of pollutants) stations, and in exchange, Eskom agrees to retire the stations by 2030 at the latest.

“For the remainder of the fleet, Eskom should commence retro-fitting the stations subject to ongoing cost assessments. Phasing out coal in the power sector by 2040 is cost-optimal for South Africa to fulfil its commitment to the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to well below 2°C without significant impact on the economy, ” Burton said.

Clean coal, the myth and the truth

The global demand for coal dropped to pre-World War II levels in 2020, according to the International Energy Agency.

“A forecasted rebound in 2021 could be short-lived, with no further increases in demand expected between 2021 to 2025, provided the economic recovery from the pandemic continues and policies remain unchanged,” it said.

The global coal sector is advocating and planning for what is now referred to as clean coal technology.

Clean coal is regularly poised as a climate change solution while the different technologies are conflated as one. In fact, the most common technologies will address air pollution — driven by particulate matter, sulphur dioxide, which contributes to acid rain and respiratory illnesses and nitrogen oxides, which contribute to smog and respiratory diseases — but not necessarily climate change-accelerating carbon emissions from the same power stations. Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas responsible for global warming.

Carbon-capturing technology, where carbon dioxide is trapped, transported and stored instead of being released into the air, will come at exorbitant costs.

Proponents of clean coal believe that because coal remains part of SA’s integrated energy resource plan beyond 2030, efforts to address its dirty air legacy must be prioritised.

But researchers maintain that coal can never be completely clean.

“Clean coal is often touted as a solution to air pollution, as coal-fired power has become increasingly uncompetitive against renewable energy. In some countries with significant domestic resources, policymakers may perceive clean coal as a way to utilise a national resource while also responding to global norms on pollution and climate change. However, the term is used loosely and often refers to divergent technology options,” said Burton.

Clean coal or clean energy

In 2019 the Centre for Environmental Rights said the technical upgrades to expiring coal-fired power stations will still be inadequate to address minimum air quality emissions standards compliance relating to toxic air pollution. No solutions can completely mitigate coal’s enormous resource consumption and harm to health and the environment, the report found.

Burton suggests that the options for Eskom boil down to whether electricity will be cleaner, more affordable and more accessible.

“The key question then is whether, for the same or better emission outcomes, alternatives can meet electricity system demand more cheaply or practically. Can newer coal plant technologies, or stations retro-fitted with carbon capture and storage, compete with alternatives such as renewables and flexible capacity (pumped storage, batteries, or gas) on cost and emission reductions?”

The cost-savings models favour retro-fitting power stations to address their contribution to toxic air, but at what cost to climate change mitigation?

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the International Energy Agency released a case study on clean coal technologies in SA that found that while efficiency improvements and advanced combustion technologies tend to reduce all polluting

emissions, the opposite may not be true: the removal of local pollutants has an energy cost and thus tends to slightly increase CO2 emissions.

In many cases, retiring old power stations early while rapidly rolling out new renewable energy to the grid will be complemented by a reduction in the cost of electricity given the steady decline in renewable energy prices. This suggests improving air quality and mitigating climate change does not need to be an either-or.

This is according to the 24th edition of PwC’s annual global CEO survey, which shows that in 2021 30% of chief executives selected climate change as an extreme concern. Last year, only 24% selected climate change as a concern.

The report further notes, however, that 27% of chief executives report being “not concerned at all” or “not very concerned” about climate change. And 60% of chief executives have not yet factored climate change into their strategic risk management activities.

At a country level, the PwC results show a moderately negative correlation between exposure to natural hazards and companies’ preparedness for climate-related risk. Companies in the countries with the most exposure, which are also among the largest contributors to carbon emissions, are less likely to have embedded climate change into their overall risk management approach, the report finds.

The decarbonisation imperative is particularly challenging for certain industries and regions, the report adds.

In South Africa, the government is in the process of taking actions to force industries to curb emissions.

These include publishing guidelines to ensure industries accurately report greenhouse gas emissions and implementing sectoral emissions targets and carbon budgets. The carbon tax will enforce the carbon budget in that sectors will be taxed at a high rate if they exceed their budget.

The PwC report also notes that in 2021 more chief executives have a positive outlook on the global economy. According to the report, 76% believe the economy will improve in the next 12 months. In 2020, only 22% expected conditions to improve.

“CEOs’ optimism also reflects momentum in vaccine development and roll-out in parts of the world,” the report reads.

“We are by no means out of the woods, but CEOs see a path forward — for the global economy, and for their own organisations.”

Chief executives’ confidence has also rebounded, with 36% saying they are “very confident” about their organisations’ prospects for revenue growth over the next 12 months. In 2019, 35% gave this answer.

In South Africa, however, business confidence fell in the first quarter of 2021. This is according to the business confidence index, calculated by Rand Merchant Bank and the Bureau of Economic Research.

The index declined from 40 to 35 in the quarter.

“This means close to seven out of 10 senior executives expressed their dissatisfaction with prevailing business conditions, up from six previously. Such low confidence levels continue to highlight the fragility of the economic recovery,” the press statement accompanying the release of the index read.

According to the statement, confidence fell across all the five sectors covered by the index. Retail experienced the biggest decline, followed by manufacturing and new vehicle dealers.

The committee was supposed to hear from the business-rescue practitioners about SAA’s progress, and further discuss the issues at the financially crippled airline.

SAA was placed under business rescue in December 2019, with the aim of creating a value proposition and ensuring the airline becomes financially viable.

The business-rescue practitioners — Les Matuson and Siviwe Dongwana — who were meant to present a report to the committee, also failed to show up. This was because one of them had a family bereavement, but Scopa only learned about this on Monday evening.

Scopa chairperson Mkhuleko Hlengwa said SAA’s no-show was disrespectful and unacceptable.

“I am very fed up. It is pointless if the people who are supposed to give us answers are not here. This is unacceptable, because the abuse of public funds is involved in this. There is big money from the public here that was abused, and we need them to account. I will let the practitioners know about the outcomes of today,” Hlengwa said.

“All of us here are working hard and doing our jobs, and they [SAA management] are slacking. They did not send anyone here, not even a representative on their behalf. I would have expected them to at least afford us that respect. All they do is postponing and not being straight with us. They send correspondence during the night or after working hours. This is becoming a norm and it is unacceptable.”

Hlengwa said that the business-rescue practitioners also appeared not to respect and want to work well with parliament.

“We do understand that there is a bereavement that one of the practitioners is attending to, and also we need to be sensitive in our work. But they should also try and improve their attitude towards the committee, because they are required to still account to parliament, regardless of being the rescue practitioners.”

According to Hlengwa, this delay is a big blow to their work, because parliament is going on recess from Friday.

“We must find a way to convene our own family meeting as Scopa, even during this break. This is very crucial and cannot be delayed much more. The work must continue,” he said.

However, this is only one of several no-shows to the committee from both SAA and the practitioners.

Democratic Alliance MP Benedicta van Minnen expressed her disappointment and frustration with SAA.

“They are floating around. Their behaviour is not acceptable, and they are showing no interest to account at all,” Van Minnen said. “The mere fact that SAA has not pitched up for this meeting, [which] is aimed at holding them accountable, is insulting and shows great disrespect for our work.”

ANC MP Sakhumzi Somyo defended the practitioners and said the committee should bear with them.

“They are not running away from anything, I believe. They are proposing that we at least give them until sometime next week,” Somyo said.

Earlier this week, Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande said the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS), which provides much-needed financial support to poor and working-class undergraduate students, faces a funding shortfall.

Nzimande pointed to two reasons for the shortfall: Covid-19, which has resulted in more eligible NSFAS applicants because of job losses in their households, and budget cuts that started before the pandemic wreaked havoc on the economy.

According to the treasury’s budget vote documents, the cabinet has approved reductions to the department of higher education’s baseline amounting to R24.6-billion over the medium term. This requires cutting NSFAS funding for loans and bursaries by R6.8-billion.

These reductions will probably lead to a decrease in the number of first‐year enrolments, the treasury document notes. “Although this will have a longer‐term impact on the number of new graduates emerging from the system, it is necessary to ensure that institutions remain sustainable and can offer quality education,” the treasury said.

On Thursday, following deadly police intervention during a protest by Wits University students, Nzimande explained that cabinet agreed that funding should be reprioritised to ensure that all deserving NSFAS-qualifying students receive funding for in 2021. Further reprioritisation can only be considered as part of the medium term budget process of government, which takes place later this year, he said

Experts say that if the scheme’s funding woes are not solved, there could be added pressure on a labour market already dealing with a high rate of youth unemployment.

Economics professor Ingrid Woolard said it is difficult to know how the NSFAS crisis will play out.

But, she added: “If a solution is not found, then this will have knock-on effects in the labour market. Some young people who had planned further study will instead try to seek work in a very weak economy.”

According to Statistics South Africa’s most recent quarterly labour force survey, the unemployment rate for people between the ages of 15 and 24 was 63.2% at the end of 2020. This is up by more than 5% compared with the same period in 2019.

The Covid-19 economic turmoil hit young workers hardest. According to global data from the International Labour Organisation (ILO), job losses were 8.7% higher for people in the 15 to 24 age group than for older workers. The pandemic also resulted in young people becoming more disconnected from the labour market, the ILO found.

Woolard noted that in South Africa, there are already about 5.5-million people under the age of 30 who are not in employment, education or training and the NSFAS crisis “will exacerbate that problem”.

The limited funding for poor students will inevitably worsen inequality in the labour market and in society as a whole, Woolard said.

“Young people from better-off families with access to family resources or credit markets will be able to attend university while those without will not be able to proceed to higher education.”

Last week the Mail & Guardian reported that funding and infrastructural woes at NSFAS had left some students with nowhere to turn.

Stanlib chief economist Kevin Lings said the government is in a difficult position because of the fiscal climate.

“Whatever area you look at, you can see there is significant financial pressure. It is not particular to youth employment,” he said.

“It is just more and more the reality of South Africa’s fiscal position; the government’s deteriorated financial position is starting to impact a broader range of social activities.”

Lings said the message from Finance Minister Tito Mboweni’s 2021 budget, which has been criticised for entrenching austerity, is that the country needs economic growth and to solve its unemployment crisis. Recent gross domestic product numbers indicate that the economy is recovering from the Covid-19 onslaught, but only after it contracted by 7% in 2020.

RELATED

“The question is, how quickly can we do that — how quickly can we lift growth? Because in the short-term, it is going to intensify,” Lings added.

Gilad Isaacs, the director of the Institute for Economic Justice, said a shortage of funding would definitely exacerbate unequal access to higher education, which in the long-term could decrease the number of skills in the economy.

But just because people are graduating does not mean they will be employed, he said. “There is not a one to one correlation with the unemployment rate.”

Isaacs added that during economic downturns, when jobs are more difficult to come by, “a good thing for young people to be able to do is go and study. Because it gives time for the economy to recover, and the absorption of the economy in four years might be better than it is now.”

Experience shows that recessionary periods should be used for upskilling and reskilling to cushion the jobless, he said.

In its study on the effects of Covid-19 on youth employment, the ILO recommended that policymakers support education and skills development.

“By combining support for the entry or re-entry of vulnerable young people to education, training and employment with macroeconomic stabilisation, such programmes can promote employment recovery as a whole,” the ILO said.",Business,https://mg.co.za/
https://mg.co.za/business/2021-03-11-rapid-inoculation-will-decrease-sas-jobless-rate/,Rapid inoculation will decrease SA’s jobless rate,"Although global economic growth is slowly picking up and vaccinations are being rolled out, research shows that for emerging markets employment recovery will take longer to get back to pre-pandemic levels. And countries’ prospects depend on how fast they can inoculate their citizens.

According to a research note by retail banking company BNP Paribas, the 2021 economic recovery will not offset unemployment, because jobs will only improve by 4 percentage points below pre-pandemic levels.

The improvement will not be enough to compensate for about 9% of jobs lost in the emerging market in 2020. “Joblessness has surged in these EMs [emerging markets] since the pandemic, and their recoveries are likely to take longer,” said the research note. The group estimates that a 17% hit on the wages in these markets is also posing a hurdle to economic recovery because people do not have enough money to spend.

“Domestic savings rates are already low in countries with high joblessness. We expect sustained spikes in unemployment to depress savings further, primarily due to weak household finances rather than a greater propensity to consume,” the bank said.

These numbers are in line with last year’s estimate of a 1.5 percentage point rise in unemployment in emerging markets to 7% in April and predictions of it reaching more than 8% in May. “Nearly 40% of EM workers are employed in sectors that have been heavily hit by the pandemic, suggesting that the fragility may linger as Covid-19 restrictions remain in place,” the research found.

In quarter one of 2021, about 30% of countries globally still imposed restrictions on non-essential services, which effectively closed down many businesses.

Although the share of countries under lockdown dropped from 90% in April last year, BNP Paribas flags that in most emerging markets, the mobility restrictions effectively prevent businesses from operating normally, hindering job prospects.

“The economic outlook for South Africa, which is also a laggard with respect to the pace of vaccinations, is perhaps the most concerning among major EMs. Beset with large structural weaknesses pre-Covid, its labour market is likely to weigh on recovery prospects,” according to the research.

To help improve the country’s economic recovery, President Cyril Ramaphosa moved the country to lockdown level one this month to increase economic activity, which could improve the country’s gross domestic product.

The economy has recovered 40% of the 2.2 million jobs lost at the height of the pandemic. This widening has seen unemployment rates worsen to a record 32.5 % in quarter four of 2020, or 42.6% when considering workforce dropouts.

As lockdown measures have been loosened, labour force participation has begun to normalise. But the absorption rates of jobs remain low.

The World Bank notes that about 25% of emerging market jobs were already vulnerable to sudden layoffs before the pandemic. Jeff Schultz, a senior economist at BNP Paribas South Africa, said the country should not underestimate the scarring done to the consumer or the time it will take to heal the country’s labour market. He added that the International Labour Organisation’s statistics placed South Africa as one of the few emerging markets to experience a real fall in wages during 2020.",Business,https://mg.co.za/

The Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) said on Wednesday it is pleased it is “all systems go” for the Act to be operational from the beginning of April.

President Cyril Ramaphosa signed the Act into law on 22 January 2019 and promulgated it in February this year.

The Act regulates the public and private funding of political parties with the aim being to establish transparency and trust between the public and political parties.

“The implementation of the Act introduces a new era of transparency within South Africa’s electoral democracy, mandating all political parties to disclose donations above R100 000 to the electoral commission. The Act also sets restrictions on sources of funding for political parties,” the IEC said.

According to the Act, political parties may not accept donations above R15-million from a single donor. It also prohibits donations from foreign governments and their agencies, foreign persons and entities, organs of state and state-owned enterprises.

Parties are obliged to fully disclose, within three months of the financial year-end, all money received, including funds and membership fees, and how those funds were used.

The regulations compel the IEC to make political party disclosures available to the public on a quarterly basis. In its pilot year, the IEC has six months to make disclosures publicly available. According to the IEC, it will publish at least one disclosure prior to this year’s local government elections expected to take place between August and November 2021.

All political parties and donors who make direct donations above R100 000 must sign up to the IEC’s online party funding system (OPFS) to make electronic disclosures to the IEC.

“As part of the system of checks and balances to help ensure transparency, donors who make direct donations above R100 000 to political parties must also declare these to the Electoral Commission on the OPFS within 30 days,” said the IEC.

The Act also put into effect the Represented Political Parties Fund (RPPF), enabling the IEC to annually disburse public money to political parties, and the Multiparty Democracy Fund (MPDF) to pay out private donations to political parties represented in national and provincial legislatures.

According to the IEC, the MPDF “presents a perfect opportunity for corporates, individuals and foundations to support multi-party democracy on a non-partisan basis. Within the parameters of applicable prescripts, contributors to the fund can request to do so anonymously should they prefer.”",Politics,https://mg.co.za/
https://mg.co.za/politics/2021-03-31-magashules-plan-to-weasel-out-of-a-tight-step-aside-corner/,Magashule’s plan to weasel out of a tight step-aside corner,"ANC secretary general (SG) Ace Magashule has hedged all his bets on the party’s branches advocating for a special conference, which he hopes will exempt him from the step-aside resolution.

Magashule is taking a page out of the playbook of his ally, former president Jacob Zuma, by hopping from region to region and from one branch to the next in the hope of gaining enough support to force the ANC’s leadership to back off.

When Zuma was removed as ANC deputy president, he was reinstated in a national general council (NGC) meeting, humiliating former president Thabo Mbeki and paving the way for his own presidency.

Mbeki subsequently lost his bid to be re-elected for a third term in Polokwane in 2007.

Sources in the ANC say Magashule is planning to tour some of the regions, including the Free State, Limpopo and KwaZulu-Natal, to mobilise support. “He wants to mobilise support from branches, who will, in turn, put pressure on national office bearers to reverse their decision. It’s a play from Zuma’s book,” one national executive committee (NEC) member said.

If he gains enough traction in provinces that have the biggest numbers, it might work, the source said. Limpopo and KwaZulu-Natal are two of the biggest provinces in terms of ANC membership.

According to the latest figures, Limpopo has 234 663 members, taking up the second spot, which was held by Mpumalanga in the lead-up to the ANC’s watershed 2017 Nasrec conference. The Eastern Cape, the third-biggest province, has 212 205 members and Mpumalanga has 181 761.

The Mail & Guardian understands that Magashule’s allies are expecting to have enough numbers to swing the step-aside decision in their favour. “If this strategy fails, ANC branches will call for a special conference where they can appeal the decision,” a source high up in the radical economic transformation (RET) faction said.

EWN reported that Magashule had told provincial secretaries during a meeting that he would not be suspended. One ANC secretary corroborated this, saying that Magashule told provincial secretaries during the NEC meeting last weekend that he was prepared to continue running ANC headquarters at Luthuli House in Johannesburg, adding that he would not be suspended or taken to a disciplinary process.

The ANC’s secretariat held a meeting on Monday in an attempt to contain growing frustration during the weekend’s NEC.

“He said he would not leave. He said he has enough support from branches to turn this around and that no one had a right to remove him except for ANC branches,” a provincial leader said. “It was [deputy secretary general] Jessie [Duarte] who tried to reason with him. She tried to calm the situation. No one supported him. He knows that if he attempts to do this, it has the potential of destroying the ANC.”

Another NEC member, one of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s lieutenants, said Magashule might also use his “most tried and tested strategy” for those who support him in the NEC to resign, which would force the party to a special conference.

“In 2005-6 and 2011, the REC [regional executive committee] of Thabo Mofutsanyana [in the Free State] had to be disbanded because a group supporting Ace had resigned. They were following Ace’s instructions to resign because he could not get things his way,” the source said.

“All provinces should know that this man uses tactics that he tested in the Free State. Many people with good struggle credentials should refuse to be victims of this preschool politics, lest they find their legacies destroyed,” the NEC member added.

Branches in the Free State, where the province’s former premier enjoys most of his support, have already penned letters to the top officials relaying their disagreement with the step-aside decision as it pertains to the secretary general.

In a letter written by regions in the Free State, they say that ANC branches of the ANC “want to state it categorically … that we disagree with the intent by the ANC NEC to remove the SG by any means necessary. We call on the NEC to take branches of the ANC seriously and value the input we make towards building a strong ANC.”

In a separate statement, the Thabo Mofutsanyana region said its regional task team does not support any attempt to “destabilise the organisation, particularly Magashule’s office”, adding that it called on the NEC to work towards building unity.

However, a provincial chair, who spoke to the M&G, said that although Magashule might gain the sympathy of some regions and branches, should he be forced to vacate his office, he would be left vulnerable in the lead-up to the NGC. This council is the ANC’s mid-term policy review conference, with powers to reverse NEC decisions.

“If you look at provinces, he doesn’t have the support of those secretaries. Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, North West, Limpopo and Gauteng secretaries are the ones he needs to reverse the decision in the NGC.

“It’s the secretaries that collate the numbers in terms of conferences and if he loses his power as SG, he loses influence with those secretaries,” the provincial leader said. “It’s the perfect time for Ramaphosa to kick him out. If he stayed longer, and he was in charge of the branch audits ahead of the NGC, then it would be a disaster for Ramaphosa and his people.”

Magashule and several other ANC leaders facing criminal charges received a red card on Monday when the NEC resolved that all those facing court charges should step aside from their roles in the party.

The decision came during a fierce meeting, which turned chaotic as Magashule’s loyalists threatened to resign. In his closing address, Ramaphosa said that those who refused to step aside after 30 days would be suspended.

Initially, sources told the M&G, the decision was that members had to step aside within seven days and then “it was extended to 14 days”.

It was at the tail-end of the meeting on Sunday that Magashule refused to sign off on the minutes, saying that no agreement had been reached by members for the step-aside resolution to be effected within the indicated days.

In a leaked email, ANC general manager Febe Potgieter-Gqubule, who is in charge of co-ordinating NEC meetings and their decisions, said the draft decisions on the step-aside rule were added to the final NEC decision document without Magashule and Duarte’s okay.

On Monday, the top six officials then decided for secretaries and Magashule’s office to be given 30 days to write to affected members informing them to step aside. Magashule said he would need to consult with party elders on the matter. On Wednesday, he said he would consult former treasurer general Mathews Phosa and Zuma. Phosa was one of the architects of the step-aside guideline.",Politics,https://mg.co.za/

Though Modise won the case, acting judge James Lukheleni rejected her argument that anybody wanting her to deviate from the default position of open voting in the National Assembly had an onus of proof to meet before the request could be granted.

When she refused the request from the ATM — a tiny party with only two MPs but links to the restive RET faction in the ANC — Modise said party leader Vuyolwethu Zungula had given only vague reasons why he wanted MPs to vote in secret.

The ATM’s argument went like this: because of a “toxic” political atmosphere in the legislature, ANC MPs would be constrained to desert their consciences and their democratic duty to hold the president to account.

Governing party lawmakers would be forced to vote along party lines because some may have benefited from the CR17 campaign that culminated in Ramaphosa’s election as ANC leader, while others may fear losing their livelihoods, especially those who served as ministers, the party said.

Worse still, it argued, some lawmakers may risk losing their lives to “political vigilantism” if they defied their whip.

But Modise said it provided her with no proof of its claims that an open ballot would mean ruling party MPs could not follow their consciences.

The matter has dragged on for more than a year since the ATM filed its motion of no confidence in the president in February last year. It was first delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic, then by the ATM rushing to court in December last year.

The party did so after Zungula in November pressed Modise to change her mind.

Modise said all things considered, she had no reason to do so.

The court rejected the ATM’s argument that Modise had failed to apply her mind when she dismissed the party’s request.

Judge Lukheleni said the courts must guard against judicial overreach in cases such as these and could only interfere if the speaker had exercised her power frivolously or unfairly or failed to apply her mind before coming to a decision.

It was his view that the correspondence between the speaker and the ATM clearly showed she had applied her mind, hence the decision stood as unimpeachable.

But in the party’s application for leave to appeal, Anton Katz SC argued that if Modise was wrong in law, her decision deserved further scrutiny.

There was a chance that another court could set aside the ruling for the reason that once she made a fundamental error in law, she did not approach the request from the ATM in the right frame of mind.

“The Speaker’s decision to reject the request could as a matter of law not be regarded as having been made rationally once she took, in the words of the honourable court, ‘the inaccurate and erroneous’ view concerning the issue of onus.”

But Katz went further and argued that the high court erred in holding that the Constitutional Court found in a case brought by the United Democratic Movement (UDM), while Jacob Zuma was president, that the default position is that motions of no confidence against the president must be decided by open ballot.

In fact, he said, the apex court explained in some detail the factors the speaker must consider when taking a decision on this.

This included giving due regard to the real possibility of corruption and whether members of the chamber could vote according to conscience, to hold the executive to account, without exposing themselves to “illegitimate hardships”.

The recent wrangling within the ANC caucus on whether the party’s MPs had to vote in support of a motion to start impeachment proceedings against public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane were illustrative, Katz said.

“It would certainly not be appropriate for a court to close its eyes to the sharp factions in the governing party, and importantly how that creates a ‘toxic’ environment in which a motion of no confidence in the president is to be conducted,” he said.

The ATM brought the motion on the basis that it believes Ramaphosa has misled parliament on load-shedding, mismanaged the economy and allowed corruption, unemployment and the waste of state resources at parastatals to escalate on his watch.

An open ballot could spell political trouble for Ramaphosa as his battle with secretary general Ace Magashule and other party members accused of corruption escalates, following a resolution that they step aside within 30 days.

But if the ATM wins leave to appeal, it means that a court decision and the actual no-confidence vote may be months away still.",Politics,https://mg.co.za/
https://mg.co.za/politics/2021-03-30-lifeline-for-magashule-but-ramaphosa-wins-this-round/,"Lifeline for Magashule, but Ramaphosa wins this round","Ace Magashule may have received a lifeline but it was President Cyril Ramaphosa who won the day when the ANC’s national executive committee (NEC) met for a four-day marathon meeting that was characterised as “chaotic”.

On Monday morning, secretary general Magashule was dealt a heavy blow, when the NEC resolved to give those facing charges seven days to step aside from their roles in the party.

But just before Ramaphosa was set to announce the decision, Magashule made known that he would not sign off on it, saying that it was smuggled into the ANC’s closing remarks.

The Mail & Guardian has received recordings of Magashule making this statement.

The ANC’s already chaotic NEC meeting descended into madness, with party chairperson Gwede Mantashe battling to maintain order among senior members.

This led to a stalemate, with the top six deciding that the meeting, originally scheduled for three days, would continue on Monday. After deliberations, the national officials resumed the meeting to announce that Magashule had asked for 30 days to consult with party elders, including former presidents, on the matter of his stepping aside.

His allies have viewed this as a lifeline — even going as far as saying the secretary general won this round — but it was Ramaphosa who seemingly had the last laugh.

Below are some of the reasons why.

Radical Economic Transformation forces

Magashule has received a great deal of his support from corners of the ANC that consider themselves as forces of Radical Economic Transformation (RET), much like his ally, former president Jacob Zuma.

Magashule’s lieutenant, Umkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans’ Association spokesperson Carl Niehaus — who also works at his office — was the architect of a basic RET manifesto. This called for the governing party to return to its socialist ideological orientation, stating that there cannot be organisational renewal without a recommitment to that approach.

In the document, Niehaus writes that the RET factions reject unity based on “abstract formulas” or a liberal approach to those who “deviate from the core of our national liberation struggle in theory and in practice”.

The NEC, however, rejected the existence of an RET grouping within the party, with Ramaphosa saying that no ANC member should associate themselves with or be involved in the so-called RET forces.

“Furthermore, the NEC will not allow any member of the ANC staff to use the resources and premises of the ANC to hold meetings of the RET or any other faction,” Ramaphosa said on Monday night.

The M&G understands from its sources that Niehaus could be facing a disciplinary process by the end of this week.

Public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane

When Magashule travelled to KwaZulu-Natal to pay his respects to the fallen Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu, he stopped by at the Gagasi FM station, a popular IsiZulu radio station, where he said that voting with the Democratic Alliance against public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane was tantamount to voting with the enemy.

In no uncertain words, Magashule expressed his disdain for the decision taken by the top six to allow for the process to investigate her fitness to hold office.

A day before, Ramaphosa, together with the party chairperson Gwede Mantashe, and treasurer general Paul Mashatile, were locked in a meeting with its caucus instructing it to “toe the party line” and vote for the process to unfold. Many Magashule supporters, including former North West chairperson Supra Mahumapelo, have indicated their dissatisfaction with the decision.

This essentially means that Magashule, who for some time held some powers within the caucus, is losing his grip.

In his statement on Monday evening, Ramaphosa said that in light of the findings of the independent experts that the public protector had a prima facie case to answer, the ANC caucus had agreed to support a motion in the National Assembly to move to the next stage of the process in terms of its rules.

In what seemed like a veiled attack on Magashule, the president said party leaders must abide by decisions of the collective and desist from making statements that contradict agreed positions of the movement.

“Public statements by any senior leader of the ANC that misrepresent policy positions of the movement and decisions of its structures are therefore

condemned without reservation,” he said.

National working committee

On Saturday the ANC voted for a new member of its national working committee (NWC), which is responsible for the day-to-day decisions of the party. With Nomaindia Mfeketo deployed to be an ambassador, the NEC nominated Ayanda Dlodlo, who has been shown to be less sympathetic to the president and Dr Gwen Ramokgopa, a Ramaphosa ally.

Ramaphosa announced that Ramokgopa would take over the NWC seat, further strengthening the president’s hold on the party structure.

Step-aside resolution

Although the step-aside resolution and the adopted guidelines became the cause of contention at the weekend meetings, with Magashule refusing to sign off on the NEC’s decision at the last moment, Ramaphosa and his allies managed to deal the so-called RET faction a fatal blow.

Magashule has often told the media and his supporters that only a special conference of branches could call for him to cease being the party’s chief administrator.

His allies, including NWC member Dakota Legoete and veteran Tony Yengeni, fought vehemently to postpone the inevitable, but the NEC resolved that party officials facing criminal charges would be given 30 days’ notice before they had to step aside from their roles.

Ramaphosa said that the NEC agreed that the provincial chairpersons and secretaries would meet with the national officials, otherwise known as the top six, to further refine the guidelines to ensure the resolution can be effectively and practically implemented.

Ironically, Magashule’s office will work with the provinces to identify all people affected and inform them of the decision

Magashule who faces a legal battle in Mangaung, having been charged with corruption, money-laundering and fraud, must step aside or face suspension.

“The NEC welcomed the decision by the ANC secretary general Ace Magashule to use this time to seek the counsel of past leaders of the movement. The NEC called on all ANC members to rally around this decision and not to engage in any acts of indiscipline, including through mobilisation or public statements that undermine implementation of the conference resolution,” Ramaphosa said.",Politics,https://mg.co.za/

Workers were scheduled to meet the top officials on Tuesday morning but it was unclear whether that meeting would start after the chaos of the NEC meeting on Sunday, which resulted in the meeting extending into Monday.

In a letter dated March 23, staff members said wages were paid late every month despite an agreement in their employment contracts and in personnel policy that the payment of salaries would take place on the 25th of each month.

One staff member said the ANC had changed the payment date without consulting staff.

“People were paid in batches. We had a staff meeting last week that ran for over two hours. People are angry, we can’t resign because we are going to be the biggest losers,” the employee said.

In their letter to ANC general manager Febe Potgieter-Gqubule, the staff members said that with the pandemic persisting, “we are likely to have this uncertainty for the foreseeable future” and requested necessary arrangements be made with creditors.

Another employee said the ANC was forcing them to go on strike. The senior staff member said among some of the difficulties experienced by employees was the non-payment of the company providence fund for more than 13 months, no increment of salaries for the past three years and the suspension of the staff medical aid fund.

“Families of comrades who died during the pandemic have not received anything because the provident fund is inactive. This is something that we can report to the relevant law enforcement structures,” said the senior staff member.

Employees told the Mail & Guardian that they were now looking at harsher action to get the employer’s attention.

“The ANC has two options, the possible option is to go for liquidation, they check who is owed how much and see how to proceed. The other alternative is to have a different provident fund. They are supposed to pay a certain portion of the fund but they don’t,” a staff member said. “We are not sure if we will get our salaries this month. It’s really bad. We are told we should not embarrass the organisation but we are not branch members who are deployed, we are not volunteers. We are professionals. It can’t go on like this.”

The ANC’s financial woes have been widely reported; the party has failed to pay staff on several occasions. Last year, President Cyril Ramaphosa had to intervene when Luthuli House failed to pay salaries.

Treasurer general Paul Mashatile apologised when December 2019 salaries were not paid before Christmas and blamed the late transfer of funds from donors.

In July last year, the Daily Maverick reported that the ANC employs 387 staff nationally, has operational costs of R6-million and a salary bill of between R20-million and R21-million.

The party receives R120-million from the Represented Political Parties’ Fund, the report said.",Politics,https://mg.co.za/
https://mg.co.za/politics/2021-03-26-atm-loses-ramaphosa-no-confidence-ballot-court-battle/,ATM loses Ramaphosa no confidence ballot court battle,"The Western Cape high court on Friday dismissed an application by the opposition African Transformation Movement (ATM) to force Speaker Thandi Modise to call a secret ballot on the first motion of no confidence against President Cyril Ramaphosa.

In a matter that has gone on for more than a year, in part because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the court found that Modise’s decision not to allow the ATM’s request was unimpeachable.

The ATM brought the motion against Ramaphosa in February last year.

It did so on the basis that it believes he has misled Parliament on load-shedding, mismanaged the economy and allowed corruption, unemployment and the waste of state resources at parastatals to escalate on his watch.

It then demanded an open ballot, arguing that ANC MPs would be constrained to desert their conscience and their democratic duty to hold the president to account because a “toxic” atmosphere prevailed in Parliament.

ATM’s Vuyolwethu Zungula said governing party lawmakers would be forced to vote along party lines because some may have benefitted from the CR17 campaign while others may fear losing their livelihoods, especially those who served as ministers. Worse still, some lawmakers may risk losing their lives to “political vigilantism” if they defied their whip.

The party has only two MPs.

A court defeat for Modise may have signalled more trouble for the president as factional battles in the ruling party come to a head.

ATM argument rejected

However, the court rejected the ATM’s argument that Modise had failed to apply her mind when she dismissed the request for a secret ballot on the basis that the reasons advanced by the party were too vague.

She said the ATM had advanced no concrete proof to support its claim that an open ballot would mean ruling party MPs could not follow their conscience.

Zungula pressed her to review her decision in November last year, but Modise said all considered, she saw no reason to do so.

Judge James Lukheleni said the courts must guard against judicial overreach in cases such as these and could only interfere if the speaker had exercised her power frivolously or unfairly or failed to apply her mind before coming to a decision.

“In my view, the correspondences exchanged between the applicant and the speaker clearly show that the Speaker applied her mind to the reasons placed before her by the applicant.

“The fact that the applicant is dissatisfied with the reasons and the decision of the Speaker, does not render the decision wrongful and is therefore not a ground for the review of her decision.”

He added: “More importantly, the fact that the applicant alleges corruption against the president does not in itself automatically warrant a secret ballot.”

Modise had tried arguing that the high court had no jurisdiction on the matter, as her decision was in effect one of the National Assembly and only the Constitutional Court could determine whether the chamber had fulfilled its obligation to hold the president to account.

Kameel Premhid, for the speaker, submitted that exclusive jurisdiction was triggered by the ATM’s argument that MPs could only vote according to conscience if they were allowed secrecy and that, failing that, Parliament could not carry out its obligation to hold the president to account.

But Anton Katz, for the ATM, argued that the case concerned a decision by the speaker and not the legislature and prevailed on this point.

The court accepted that the ATM’s complaint was procedural in nature. Its case was not that Parliament or the president had failed in a constitutional duty, but merely challenged a decision by the speaker that was part of the means to achieving that end.",Politics,https://mg.co.za/

https://mg.co.za/politics/2021-03-24-a-major-cabinet-reshuffle-is-on-the-cards/,A major cabinet reshuffle is on the cards,"A major shake-up in the department of public enterprises has been mooted as President Cyril Ramaphosa mulls over slashing his bloated cabinet. Several sources close to the talks told the Mail & Guardian that Ramaphosa is gearing up to move some of the beleaguered state-owned enterprises from Minister of Public Enterprises Pravin Gordhan’s portfolio. Among them is South African Airways (SAA), which is expected to move to Minister Fikile Mbalula’s transport portfolio.

The sources also told the M&G that the struggling power utility Eskom will be transferred to the department of energy under Minister Gwede Mantashe.

One source said there were talks of a possible cabinet reshuffle held just last week.

Ramaphosa is still deciding whether he should bite the bullet and axe some of his struggling cabinet ministers. However, according to another source, the president may make an announcement soon.

“There is that debate that we collapse public enterprises because the portfolios are two-fold. For instance, with Eskom, you find that Gwede is struggling to enforce action in minerals and energy.”

One source said: “Gwede has been vocal that he feels there is a stranglehold, because there are two portfolios which handle sections of our energy generation. Independent power producers (IPPs) are in his hands, and yet Eskom is with Pravin. This creates confusion, and considering the state of Eskom, we need to be more decisive when forging ahead with a rescue plan.”

Mantashe has in the past told the media that having Eskom under Gordhan’s department only made it more difficult to manage the power utility. Analysts have called the infighting between Gordhan and Mantashe a “titanic clash” as the two powerful ANC ministers are Ramaphosa’s strongest allies.

Cosatu, which has never favoured Gordhan, has in the past also indicated that Eskom should be shifted towards the department of energy and minerals for a better synergy.

News of the possible collapse of Gordhan’s portfolio comes after Mantashe announced that the government had sourced eight IPPs to help boost Eskom’s waning energy supply.

Last week Mantashe said these IPPs would provide energy from wind, liquified energy gas and solar energy, with a boost from the private sector totalling R45-billion.

Recently Mantashe has been at the helm of unlocking strategies to help boost the power utility, with Gordhan seemingly taking a back seat.

“It’s simple, and it all has to do with the line of reporting at Eskom. As the regulator, when you don’t have the powers you are disregarded. It’s like you [are] just suggesting and proposing, and then public enterprises have the power to do something completely different. Load shedding is another challenging area. Gwede has nothing to do with it, yet people look at him. It makes more strategic sense to move Eskom,” one party insider said.

The high-ranking ANC and government insiders have also indicated that SAA, which is currently under business rescue, will be moved to the transport ministry.

SAA received a total bailout of R10.5-billion from the government last year, with some of that money paid out earlier this year.

The national carrier was placed under business rescue in December 2019 amid allegations of mismanagement, which left the airline unable to pay its debt. The business rescue practitioners have reportedly indicated to creditors that it could hand back the company by the end of this month.

“There has been a confusion of roles and responsibilities, and alignment of roles and responsibilities is needed. Out of the analysis that has been worked out, we will not end this month without a decision being made and communicated with the country. It’s almost as good as done; there are a few details that need to be ironed out. Most pressing is the replacement of the members of the executive who have died. A critical role like the one of the minister in the presidency needs to be filled,” one party leader said.

Former minister in the presidency Jackson Mthembu died in February this year after complications related to Covid-19. Ramaphosa also suffered a loss when deputy minister of mineral resources Bavelile Hlongwa died in a car accident last year. Both of these positions have not been filled, but in the meantime Ramaphosa appointed Minister of Small Business Development Khumbudzo Ntshavheni as Acting Minister in the Presidency.

There has also been speculation that Public Works and Infrastructure Minister Patricia de Lille could be moved to a different portfolio.

In January, an insider said there was a debate among Ramaphosa’s advisers about replacing De Lille with a senior provincial leader, whose name is known to the M&G.

De Lille recently ruffled feathers in the ANC when she demanded that MPs repay rent for ministerial houses, the Sunday Times reported.

“She comes from the PAC generation, and she is a no-nonsense person. I don’t think she will be replaced, but she is no pushover, and she is strong enough to execute her job even if [her decisions are] not popular. If he removes her, she should be reshuffled to a position where she will have the most impact,” the party leader said.

Ramaphosa has been criticised for doing very little to trim his bloated cabinet, barring when he took office in 2019, when he cut his cabinet from former president Jacob Zuma’s 36 to 28.

He has indicated during media engagements that he is considering slimming his executive further.",Politics,https://mg.co.za/

Sources also revealed that Ntuthu, who was the regional secretary in the dysfunctional Amathole region of the ANC, fought and lobbied provincial executive committee members to the bitter end in trying to stave off having his membership suspended and being booted out of his powerful regional position.

Insiders said the Mail & Guardian article published almost two weeks ago, in which it was reported that the Ngqushwa local municipality made more than R10-million in bogus payments to swell ANC regional coffers in preparation for the upcoming Amathole regional conference, was the final stick used to remove Ntuthu.

RELATED

Ntuthu, according to sources, ran roughshod over the Amathole district municipality, which encompasses Ngqushwa and five other local municipalities. The municipality announced in January that it would fail to pay salaries from February to June because of being in financial ruin.

All of these factors, sources added, as well as the R10-million corruption case for the alleged mismanagement of a tender in Mnquma local municipality (which is one of those that falls under Amathole) for the procurement of black plastic bags, were used to remove Ntuthu from his position. Ntuthu, who appeared in court last week on the plastic bags saga, has maintained his innocence since his 2017 arrest.

But, speaking to the M&G on Tuesday, Ntuthu denied any knowledge of his suspension.

“I am not aware of any suspension by the [provincial executive committee], Mhlekazi [sir],” Ntuthu said.

However, Lulama Ngcukayitobi, the Eastern Cape ANC’s provincial secretary, revealed at a briefing on Tuesday that, not only was Ntuthu aware of his suspension, he was part of the executive committee meeting that ratified his removal.

“Letters [of suspension] are being written in the office. Fortunately, [some] of [those suspended] were part of the meeting. But, having said so, that does not mean they must not be formally informed as individual members.

“So, they’re being informed [and] their individual conditions [are] being addressed in the letters they’re going to get,” Ngcukayitobi said in response to an M&G question.

Ngcukayitobi said one of the conditions of Ntuthu’s suspension was that he was banned from representing or talking about the ANC on any public platform or to the media.

Ntuthu was also removed from his powerful regional secretary position, in which he was involved in deploying ANC members to key municipal positions. Another aspect of this role was organising the regional conference, slated for May. Ntuthu was said to be preparing to oust Eastern Cape premier and ANC provincial chairperson Oscar Mabuyane at the subsequent provincial conference, sources say.

Ngcukayitobi said the provincial conference was expected to be held in June.

He added that the provincial ANC was concerned about the dire financial situation Amathole found itself in.

“In our earlier discussion — I think it was almost a month ago — we agreed that a forensic investigation on the occurrences of that particular institution must be done and speeded up,” Ngcukayitobi said. “Secondly, we are concerned about the finances … and that the MEC of Cogta [co-operative governance and traditional affairs, Xolile Nqatha], minister of Cogta [Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma], the finance minister [Tito Mboweni] and treasury in the Eastern Cape must establish a team to work with the district municipality of Amathole.”

Ngcukayitobi said the provincial Eastern Cape used the ANC’s rule 25.70 to remove Ntuthu. The rule, added Ngcukayitobi, empowered the provincial secretary to remove an office bearer “in the best interests of the organisation”.

In his closing address on Monday after the provincial executive committee meeting, Mabuyane came out strongly in affirming its commitment to the ANC’s “step aside” rule.

“We have reiterated our position that all members of the organisation that are formally charged for corruption and serious crimes should step aside from their positions of responsibility,” Mabuyane asserted.",Politics,https://mg.co.za/

ANC secretary Lulama Ngcukayitobi said this when he announced that the provincial executive committee (PEC) had suspended five of its members, who are facing court charges.

Ngcukayitobi said the PEC expected a fight-back from members, adding that, “Those that benefited from the capture and corruption will do whatever that is in their power to fight back.”

Ngcukayitobi was also asked by journalists to react to the warring factions in the ANC nationally.

Not mincing his words, the secretary of the third-largest province in the ANC said the radical economic transformation (RET) groups that have been vehemently defending Magashule and former president Jacob Zuma, were not outside of how the Economic Freedom Fighters and the Congress of the People were formed.

“The ANC must confront that particular reality: that both organisations were formed in the belly of the ANC. Therefore, the ANC should be alive to the risk of keeping some individuals in the head offices working in the office of the secretary general and pronouncing themselves outside the ANC.

“That RET thing that is found in the ANC sixth floor of Luthuli House is nothing of the sort of a tendency of a faction, but it has grown into a formidable organisation that will contest the ANC,” he said, adding that the ANC should deal with it as an organisation, rather than a tendency.

Ngcukayitobi said the RET group were trying to “create a basis for a splinter” should the party implement its resolution on the renewal of the organisation.

“It’s clear that we must deal decisively with rogue elements within the organisation,” he said.

His statements come after Umkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association spokesperson Carl Niehaus, who also works at Magashule’s office, penned an RET manifesto, called Radical Economic Transformation: a Basic Document, with the subtitle, Unpacking RET in alignment to the Freedom Charter.

The document calls for the governing party to return to its socialist ideological orientation, stating that there cannot be organisational renewal without a recommitment to that approach.

In the document, Niehaus, who has been at the forefront of the RET group particularly in Gauteng, writes that the RET factions reject unity based on “abstract formulas” or a liberal approach to those who deviate from the core of our national liberation struggle in theory and in practice.

“We reject unity that is not based on a clear commitment to the core of the national democratic revolution, which is to shift economic power to African people the majority of whom are working class. We reject unity that is based on this or that individual agreeing to share positions of leadership. We reject unity that is based on blind loyalty to this or that leader; unity that is based on money politics, regardless of whether the leader deviates from the core of our national liberation politics in their public and private pronouncements,” the document stated.

In a statement released on 11 March, the RET’s national operations committee — which is not recognised by the motherbody — resolved to use the paper as a discussion and mobilisation document in engaging with the branches and members of the ANC throughout the country.

“Concern was expressed that the NGC [national general council] discussion documents, which the ANC issued last year, fail to reflect the correct ideological position of radical economic transformation as the official economic policy programme of the ANC. These discussion documents do not reflect and promote the RET resolutions that were taken at the 54th national conference of the ANC, and are imbued by neoliberal economic policies that are alien to the liberation history and revolutionary character of the ANC,” the committee’s statement read.",Politics,https://mg.co.za/

Francois Rodgers, the chief whip in the provincial legislature, will also contest the position. Current KwaZulu-Natal leader Zwakhele Mncwango, who was a close ally of former DA national leader Mmusi Maimane, will not stand for a second term.

The congress was meant to take place last month, but had to be delayed to allow 65 of the party’s 229 branches to be relaunched.

The DA provincial leadership had requested that the branches, mainly in rural parts of the province, be relaunched, because the party’s electronic voting system had not been used when they were launched initially. The party’s federal executive agreed and the branches were relaunched, with the last being certified two weeks ago.

The congress will be held in a hybrid format to allow delegates to attend either in person or online.

Rodgers, 59, the current DA KwaZulu-Natal provincial chairperson, is a party veteran who started his career as the party’s lone councillor in the Kokstad municipality in rural northwestern KwaZulu-Natal.

The serving chief whip in the legislature is, according to a number of party members, the most likely of the three candidates to replace Mncwango, who was elected as leader in 2018.

Rodgers, who previously served as deputy DA leader in KwaZulu-Natal, believes the party is in a “unique” position in the province, one of only two in which it bucked the national trend and grew its slice of the provincial vote in the 2019 elections.

The party has also grown significantly in rural communities in which it previously had little or no presence, a path that Rodgers said it would continue to follow in the province.

“I started off as a ‘lone ranger’ councillor at Kokstad. Based in a rural constituency, I didn’t see the party moving into the areas beyond eThekwini and Msunduzi. My interest is in trying to grow the demographic of the party in areas other than the urban centres,” he said.

For example, Rodgers said the party had grown its vote in Ixopo’s ward 18, a predominantly black, rural ward, from zero in 2006 to 30% in 2016.

“You cannot parachute into a rural community before the elections with pamphlets and think this will convince people. You have to build your structures, engage with the community over time, assist them. That is the formula that works,” he said.

If Graham, the DA’s highly vocal eThekwini caucus chair and exco representative, wins the race to be leader, she will, at 31, be the party’s youngest provincial leader. Graham has been a DA member since the age of 17 and has served as a ward and proportional representation councillor in eThekwini since 2011.

Graham said she believes the set of skills and the experience she has gained in eThekwini, where she leads a 61-member contingent of DA councillors, make her a suitable candidate for party provincial leader.

“I’ve stayed in local government for the time I have, when a lot of people would have moved on, as I have been motivated by balancing what would suit my skills best and what would be of most benefit to the party, the people who vote for it and the people we serve,” Graham said.

“We have built up a formidable team here. We are the only metro where the DA grew in 2019, under very tough conditions.”

Mhlongo, 46, who is the DA’s eThekwini deputy caucus leader, has served nine years in council and 10 with the party.

A key figure in driving the DA’s growth in the north Durban townships, Bulwer-born Mhlongo ran a series of successful businesses before moving into full-time politics.

He said the harsh poverty of his upbringing in the rural KwaZulu-Natal Midlands — and the failure of the ANC government to eradicate this poverty — was his main motivation for joining the DA.

“This government till today has not resolved the problem of poverty which we grew up with. I believe that by taking the government head-on, we can ensure that they do work to change the lives of people.”

Mhlongo said his combination of organisational skills, experience and his ability to draw new voters to the DA made him a strong candidate for provincial leader.

Like Rodgers, Mhlongo believes growing the DA in black communities will continue to see it take votes from the ANC in the province in this year’s local government elections.

Mhlongo’s efforts in north Durban saw it take wards 51, 58 and 106 from the ANC, which had held them for several terms. “We also grew in ward 39,” Mhlongo said.",Politics,https://mg.co.za/
https://mg.co.za/politics/2021-03-18-high-court-reserves-judgment-on-bid-to-reveal-ramaphosas-donors/,High court reserves judgment on bid to reveal Ramaphosa’s donors,"The high court in Pretoria has reserved judgment on the Economic Freedom Fighters’ bid to force the release of the financial records of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s campaign for the leadership of the ANC, after hearing that the public interest outweighed the right to privacy.

The argument came from EFF counsel Ishmael Semenya SC, who said opening the campaign records was demanded by the principles of open justice.

The legal team for the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) countered this by pointing out that the information on money flows the body provided to embattled public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane were never before open court.

Advocate Les Morrison, for the FIC, said disclosure of the record would violate the confidentiality clauses in the Financial Intelligence Act.

The FIC provided Mkhwebane with information during her investigation into whether Ramaphosa had misled parliament with an answer in the National Assembly on a donation by Bosasa.

Mkhwebane strayed beyond her remit by delving into other donations to the campaign and concluded that the evidence pointed towards money-laundering.

Ramaphosa had her report overturned in a damning court ruling against Mkhwebane, one of several that may see her impeached for incompetence.

According to the FIC and the president’s legal counsel, the record of payments to the campaign were part of Mkhwebane’s record of decision in reaching her findings, and were not part of the court record.

Moreover, she was always warned that it could not be released.

Ramaphosa successfully petitioned North Gauteng Deputy Judge President Aubrey Ledwaba to seal the record, until the parties could reach an agreement on which portions should be open. She subsequently defied an instruction from the judge to file the papers to his office, instead deposing these with the registrar.

Ledwaba had the papers transferred to his office.

Wim Trengove SC, appearing for the CR17 committee, also advanced the argument that the documents the EFF is demanding be open for all to see never made to an open court.

The party launched the case late last year as the political fight-back against Ramaphosa escalated, with his foes claiming the donations would reveal that he was captive to capitalist interests.

The party is leaning on the constitution and the Electoral Act to argue that donations to individuals in a party should be public, as a deterrent to corruption, in the same manner that by law, of late, donations to political parties must be disclosed.

Semenya said Ramaphosa’s objective in becoming president of the party was always to become president of the country, hence the campaign could not be separated from his election as head of state.

Trengove argued that Ramaphosa’s bid for the ANC presidency involved a private campaign and a private contest in which the general public did not vote.

Reserving judgment after two days of argument, Judge Cassim Sardiwalla remarked that the case was of considerable public interest.",Politics,https://mg.co.za/
https://mg.co.za/politics/2021-03-17-ramaphosa-cant-separate-funding-for-anc-bid-from-becoming-president-high-court-hears/,"Ramaphosa can’t separate funding for ANC bid from becoming president, high court hears","Legal counsel for the Economic Freedom Fighters on Tuesday told the high court in Pretoria that President Cyril Ramaphosa could not divorce his campaign to become president of the ANC from electoral law, and keep the funding that flowed to it secret, because his ultimate purpose was the highest public office.

Advocate Ishmael Semenya SC argued that Ramaphosa’s stance that the donations to the campaign were private and that documents detailing the money flow obtained by Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane should remain sealed, was not tenable.

He referred to conversations on record in which Ramaphosa told both his family and Mkhwebane that he had understood that becoming party leader would lead to becoming state president.

“I never thought it was to my direct benefit, and it was kept away from me, anyway,” the president told the public protector.

“It was just for the campaign in the ANC and not for the republic, although that would happen as it did.”

This quote vindicates the point, Semenya said, that both the president and his campaign managers knew that while they were seeking donations to advance his position in the party, that it would ultimately translate into the public office.

Ramaphosa had submitted that he was elected as president by the National Assembly but, Semenya noted, he arrived there through an electoral process enshrined in law, and by virtue of his position on the ANC’s list.

“That office could only be assumed, as we point out, by the constitution itself, as well as by the Electoral Act,” Semenya said.

Hence, the argument that there was a difference between political-party and intra-party funding was an artificial and flawed one here, he argued.

“That is not an adequate ground to resist the disclosure of all this information.”

Semenya recalled the ruling of the Constitutional Court in the My Vote Counts case, which held that transparency of private funding of political parties promoted both the detection of improper influence on public office bearers and the fight against corruption.

That judgment led to the recent enactment of the Law on Private Party Funding Act, which requires disclosure of donations to parties.

Connecting the dots …

Semenya said the fact that two of the administrators of the CR17 campaign had since become advisers in Ramaphosa’s presidency begged the question: “Are there any other dots to be connected?”

The bank records of the campaign were obtained by Mkhwebane from the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) in the course of her investigation into a complaint that Ramaphosa misled Parliament on a donation from Bosasa to the CR17 campaign.

Ramphosa successfully took her findings, which included a recommendation that he be investigated for money-laundering, on legal review.

In August last year, Mkhwebane filed the bank records with the registrar of the high court, in defiance of an order by Deputy Judge President Aubrey Ledwaba that the record be filed to his office.

Ledwaba then directed that the record be transferred to his office, that the FIC report remain sealed and that any party who wished to challenge this should do so in court. Neither Mkhwebane nor the EFF initially did so.

But late last year, the party launched this separate high court bid to force the disclosure of the records of four bank accounts linked to Ramaphosa’s campaign.

Semenya’s co-counsel, Kameel Premhid, argued that bank records reflecting donations to the campaign were part of the court record filed in terms of rule 53 of the Uniform Rules of Court and should by default be open to scrutiny.

He questioned why the applicants bore a reverse onus to show that the default position be restored.

“The facts have not overtaken the circumstances … we are squarely in rule 53 territory,” he argued.

But the legal teams for the president and the FIC counter in their papers that the bank records were never part of the court record.

Instead, they were part of Mkhwebane’s record of decision, and the FIC had warned her that the information was intelligence, not evidence — and that she could not do with it as she pleased.

The FIC’s lawyers argue, with Ramaphosa’s in full agreement, that the EFF cannot force the disclosure of the information because this much was refused throughout the original litigation over Mkhwebane’s report.

As put by Ramaphosa’s lawyers: “The information can only be disclosed for the purposes set out in the FIC Act. The EFF does not bring itself within the Act. This really should be the end of the matter.”

It is preposterous, they add, that the EFF should portray itself as seeking to hold the president to account when constitutionally this responsibility resides with parliament. The court bid comes amid growing pressure on Ramaphosa from his political foes over his campaign donations, which they claim make him beholden to capitalist interests.",Politics,https://mg.co.za/

https://mg.co.za/politics/2021-03-16-local-government-elections-covid-19-adds-to-iecs-challenges/,Local government elections: Covid-19 adds to IEC’s challenges,"After allegations of irregularities in the 2019 national election, the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) is set to make some progressive adjustments to address these issues in the upcoming 2021 local government elections (LGE).

Incidents of double voting, shortages of indelible ink and ballot papers at voting stations, and several smaller parties even threatening court action against the IEC were just some complaints received during the 2019 national election.

With no set date for the elections yet, the IEC says consultations with the Minister of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, have commenced. The date remains unspecified, but with the current municipal councils elected on 3 August 2016, the window period in which the elections must take place is between 4 August and 1 November 2021.

In catching up with by-elections at the end of 2020 after delays due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the IEC has had the opportunity to test their implementation of the necessary Covid-19 health protocols.

But the commission’s deputy chief electoral officer Masego Shiburi says that delivering nation-wide elections during the pandemic remains a challenge: “Health and safety protocols have been introduced into voter registration and voting procedures to mitigate the risk of transmission of the virus. However, the unknown relates to the impact of the pandemic on the voter turnout and demand for special vote home visits.”

He adds that local elections are operationally more challenging and complex compared to national and provincial elections.

“In national and provincial elections, there are 10 elections in total. In the 2021 municipal elections, there will be a total of 4 725 unique elections, comprising 4 468 ward elections, eight metropolitan council elections, 205 local council elections and 44 district council elections,” explains Shiburi.

In addition to logistical demands, the IEC also takes into consideration the current political climate. Shiburi notes that municipal and ward boundaries, possible intra-political party disputes during the nomination of candidates, as well as inter-political party competition and tensions “makes for a challenging and litigious environment in which to deliver credible, free and fair elections”.

Despite Covid-19 threats and a R35-million budget cut, the IEC promises progressive adjustments to this year’s local government elections.

To prevent double-voting, the IEC is still in the procurement process of voter management devices (VMD) to “ensure that a voter does not present herself to vote at more than one voting station in the elections”.

The IEC says it has improved the specifications of the indelible ink’s chemical content — used to prevent people from voting more than once — and will focus on the improved application thereof in voting officials’ training.

The IEC is busy procuring upgraded technology for identity document or card scanners, which will be used in the voter registration and voting procedures, to improve both the voter registration and voting procedures.

On the issue of ensuring that there are enough ballot papers at each polling station, the IEC trusts that “in the context of local government elections, it is not possible for a voter to vote where they are not registered,” thus preventing ballot paper shortages.

Members of the public who want to report election disinformation will be able to use an online platform, the same as employed during the national and provincial elections in 2019. Specifics regarding the online platform are yet to be finalised, says Shiburi.",Politics,https://mg.co.za/
https://mg.co.za/politics/2021-03-16-mantashe-calls-for-urgent-caucus-meeting-ahead-of-mkhwebane-vote/,Mantashe calls for urgent caucus meeting ahead of Mkhwebane vote,"ANC chairperson Gwede Mantashe has called an urgent meeting with the party’s parliamentary caucus ahead of a vote to allow for a committee to investigate public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s fitness to hold office.

The meeting, scheduled for Tuesday afternoon, comes after secretary general Ace Magashule on Monday received at least five letters from caucus members expressing unhappiness with chief whip Pemmy Majodina’s media statement that the caucus had resolved to go ahead with the process on Mkhwebane’s fitness to hold office.

The top six held a meeting on Monday at which it was decided that Mantashe — together with Magashule — must quell growing tensions in the party caucus emerging from the imminent vote on whether Mkhwebane’s fitness should be investigated by parliament.

The Mail & Guardian has previously reported that in a letter to Magashule and Majodina, ANC MP Marvin Dirks stated the caucus is split on the matter.

In his correspondence, Dirks said two views were expressed in the caucus, adding that he found it “unfair that you released a statement based on one view that was expressed in the caucus”.

“Secondly, there were no extensive discussions in the caucus due to time constraints and many comrades who raised their hands did not get an opportunity, therefore, it is not true that the matter was extensively discussed, in fact towards the end chaos erupted over the matter and the caucus chair brought the matter abruptly to an end,” Dirks wrote.

He added that Majodina’s public statement failed to mention that the caucus resolved that she must seek a mandate from the ANC’s top six, through Magashule’s office.

In her statement, Majodina said the caucus resolved to support the process and acknowledged that it was not at a point to deal with the merits or demerits of the case. The caucus affirmed the rules of the National Assembly and how they regulate what the speaker can and cannot do in cases of heads of chapter nine institutions, such as the office of the public protector, she added.

In his own letter to Magashule on Monday, Umkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans’ Association chairperson Kebby Maphatsoe said Majodina’s media statement supporting a vote to decide to endorse or reject the independent panel’s report was disingenuous, and did not reflect the scope of the discussion that took place in the caucus.

Maphatsoe said that in having done so, Majodina had complicated and compromised a very simple and straightforward matter.

“To participate in a vote about the acceptance or rejection of the report of the independent panel, is to participate in a process that is unfolding in support of the Democratic Alliance’s [DA’s] clearly stated intention to remove the public protector from office,” he said.

“Thus, for any ANC MP to vote with the Democratic Alliance is contrary to rule 25.17.13 of the ANC constitution, which describes, with regards to the duties of members, office bearers and representatives, that an act of misconduct is: ‘Joining or supporting a political organisation, other than an organisation in alliance with the ANC, in a manner contrary to the aims, objectives and policy of the ANC’.

“The DA is certainly not an organisation that is in alliance with the ANC, and, therefore, to vote in a process that has been initiated, promoted and sponsored by the DA constitutes a flagrant contravention of our ANC constitution,” Maphatsoe added.

The ANC vote will serve as a bellwether for other proxy battles playing out in the party.

A simple majority of 50 plus one is needed for the report tabled by a panel comprising former Constitutional Court judge Bess Nkabinde and advocates Dumisa Ntsebeza and Johan de Waal to be passed, prompting parliament to begin a section 194 inquiry that could see Mkhwebane impeached.

If all 231 ANC members in the house heed party instructions, it will pass, despite the opposition of the Economic Freedom Fighters, which has not wavered in backing Mkhwebane.

The question is how many, if any, ANC MPs will break ranks and vote to protect the partisan Mkhwebane, whose repeated mistakes, disparaged by the courts and the three-person panel, served to shield those in the so-called radical economic transformation faction and further their agenda against President Cyril Ramaphosa.",Politics,https://mg.co.za/
https://mg.co.za/special-reports/2021-03-31-facial-recognition-on-the-rise-as-businesses-go-touchless/,Facial recognition on the rise as businesses go touchless,"Demand for facial recognition access control systems is booming as South African businesses scramble to provide touchless technology and eliminate touch surfaces that can spread Covid-19.

In many cases, these systems are combined with thermal screening technologies that enable temperature measurement, while also providing a fully auditable logbook of every person who enters and leaves a building, says Neal Harvey, a security solutions consultant at Itec SA.

“There’s been a clear increase in demand for touchless access control solutions since the pandemic hit. Key card access control systems and even fingerprint readers are quickly becoming obsolete: cards get lost or misplaced, and nobody wants to touch a biometric reader in a time of Covid.”

Facial recognition as a biometric identification solution has matured over the last few years, making it an affordable alternative to traditional card and fingerprint readers. It has the added benefits of being contactless, and cannot be lost or passed on, making it more secure than some legacy access control systems. This advancement in technology has also made visitor management more secure, with the ability to do visitor registrations online instead of visitors having to fill out paper-based forms.

Another game changer for local businesses is the adoption of cloud-based access systems. Traditional access control systems are expensive, requiring servers, wiring and annual software licensing. Cloud-based access control brings secure access within the reach of most businesses by offering a subscription-based model, with the software hosted in the cloud and managed by a third-party provider.

“Cloud is the future of access control, and we’re going to see this model becoming standard practice in the coming years. Businesses don’t need to hire IT people to manage the system anymore or worry about scheduling updates and maintenance. They also get the flexibility of being able to grant or modify access credentials from a single database that is remotely accessible,” says Harvey.

There has also been a rise in multi-factor authentication, which requires the use of more than one credential to gain access. Once reserved for high-security and critical infrastructure facilities, companies are starting to explore various combinations of authentication, such as combining facial recognition with mobile credentials.

“The bottom line is that no two companies’ requirements are the same. They’re all looking for flexibility, safety and convenience, and technology that prioritises user health and wellness across the physical and digital spaces. Facial recognition by itself is still a relatively small part of the broader security market, but as the technology that enables it becomes cheaper and more accessible, it will become an integral part of most businesses’ security arsenal,” concludes Harvey.
